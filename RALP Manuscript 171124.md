**Abstract**

**Introduction**

Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) is the dominant surgical approach for prostate cancer worldwide. Robotic surgery poses a steep learning curve. This learning curve is supported by modular training and the da Vinci Surgical System© dual console, where specialists supervising trainees can assume control from a secondary console if required. Here we evaluate the safety of robotic training using a modular training approach supported by the dual console by comparing pathological and peri-operative outcomes of RALPs performed predominantly by a urology trainee with RALPs performed predominantly by specialist robotic surgeons.

**Methods**

This prospective cohort study examines RALPs performed at a tertiary robotic training centre in Australia between February 2017 and August 2018. A case was considered a ‘trainee-lead case’ if the trainee completed more than 75% of the operative steps. We compared patient demographics, operative parameters, peri-operative outcomes, and pathological outcomes between groups. Each case was divided into 13 steps from port placement to specimen retrieval. Categorical variables were analysed using the Chi-square test and continuous variables were analysed using the independent t-test.

**Results**

Of 126 cases in this study, 39 (31%) were trainee-led cases and 87 (69%) were specialist lead cases. There was no significant difference in operative or pathological outcomes between trainee-lead cases and specialist-lead cases. Our results compared favourably with local and international benchmarks.

**Conclusion**

RALP performed by trainees using a modular training approach can have equivalent peri-operative and pathological outcomes to specialist-led cases. This is achieved by appropriate case selection, close supervision, and graded progression.

**Introduction**

Prostate cancer is the second-most diagnosed cancer worldwide [1] and the fifth-leading cause of cancer-related mortality [2]. Treatment modalities include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy [3]. Treatment recommendations are informed by goals of therapy, disease profile, comorbidities, and patient preferences. Patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer are counselled on both surgical intervention and radiation therapy [4].

Surgical techniques for prostatectomy include open radical prostatectomy (ORP), laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP), and robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) [5]. Traditionally, ORP was most commonly performed. However, with the emergence of the da Vinci Surgical System© (Intuitive Surgical, CA, USA), first used for prostatectomy in 2001, RALP is now the dominant surgical approach [6]. Worldwide, 62% of prostatectomies performed are RALPs, 39% LRPs, and 1% ORPs [7–10]. In Australia, there has been a steady shift to RALP and it is now the dominant approach in metropolitan centres [11].

Achieving robotic proficiency requires access to robotic systems, sufficient caseload, and a training environment that supports stepwise progression. Currently in Australia there is no structured urological robotic surgery curriculum, which limits exposure for trainees outside of major robotic centres. As with any procedural training, robotic training opportunities must be balanced with patient safety and quality assurance. The steep learning curve in robotic surgery [13] can limit operative time for trainees, particularly in lower volume centres. The dual console system in the da Vinci Surgical System© supports this learning curve by facilitating one-on-one training from specialists supervising from the secondary console. Modular training promotes step-wise development through achievable, compartmentalised exercises. This modular training method allows trainees to function as the primary surgeon within a structured educational framework. This learning system was designed to prioritise trainee operative surgical skills acquisition without compromising patient outcomes [14].

Here we assess the efficacy of modular training in RALP at a leading tertiary institution in Australia with a high volume of urological robotic procedures. This study compares outcomes of RALPs performed predominantly by specialist urologists with those performed predominantly by urology trainees. This assessment will determine patient safety, procedural quality, and teaching outcomes in RALP using a modular training approach.

**Methods**

This study reviews prospective data from the Nepean Hospital Urology Department in Sydney, Australia from February 2017 to August 2018. Ethics approval was obtained via the Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District Human Research and Ethics Committee (approval number: Study 17-53A).

***Case selection***

Patients who underwent RALPs with the da Vinci Surgical System© between February 2017 and August 2018 were included in this study. Eight RALP specialists and four fellowship level or penultimate year urology trainees (two in 2017 and two in 2018) performed the RALPs in this study. Urology trainees completed all introductory da Vinci Surgical System© in-built training modules prior to participating in patient cases.

Case selection was determined by case difficulty and trainee experience. As trainees’ technical competency developed throughout the study, trainees performed a greater number of operative steps independently, supervised at all times by specialist urologists on the dual console. Mastery of each operative step by trainees was determined by individual performance rather than case numbers. Cases were allocated to the trainee-lead group or the specialist-lead group at the conclusion of the case according to the proportion of the procedure completed by the trainee. Given case allocation was performed at the conclusion of the procedure, patients were not informed of the proportion of steps performed by the trainee unless they explicitly enquired. This is consistent with standard operative practice for comparable procedures at our institution.

***Operative steps***

In every RALP, the following key operative steps were performed by the urology trainee or the specialist urologist:

1. Robot docking and port placement
2. Retropubic dissection
3. Endopelvic fascia incision
4. Anterior bladder neck transection
5. Posterior bladder neck transection
6. Dissection of seminal vesicles and vas deferens
7. Denonvillier dissection
8. Lateral pedicle dissection
9. Ligation of dorsal venous plexus
10. Apical dissection and urethral division
11. ROCCO stitch
12. Urethrovesical anastomosis
13. Specimen retrieval +/- pelvic lymph node dissection

If the trainee completed more than 75% of the operative steps (10 of 13), the case was classified as a ‘trainee-lead case’.

***Data collection***

At the completion of each RALP, the urology trainee involved completed the data collection form (Appendix 1). Peri-operative parameters including age, body mass index (BMI), pre-operative haemoglobin level, pre-operative prostate specific antigen level (PSA), prostate volume, International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group, and pathological stage were recorded. Operative parameters included total console time, estimated intra-operative blood loss, blood transfusion requirement, intra-operative adverse events, post-operative intensive care requirements, length of hospital stay (LOS), duration of urethral catheterisation, and the degree of pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) performed. Thirty-day Clavien-Dindo (CD) complications were also recorded. Pathological outcomes collected were surgical margin status and detectability of PSA at 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively.

***Data storage and analysis***

A data manager and a research assistant entered the information collected from the data collection form into a master Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, WA, USA) sheet. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 10 (Dotmatics, MA, USA). Continuous variables were reported as mean and standard deviation and analysed using the independent t-test. Categorical variables were reported as frequency data and analysed using the Chi-square test.

**Results**

Of 126 cases included in the study, 31% (n=39) were performed by urology trainees and 69% (n=87) were performed by specialist urologists. Of the 87 cases performed predominantly by specialist urologists, the number of steps completed by a urology trainee ranged from 0-5 (0-38%) of the 13 operative steps. Table I demonstrates patient demographics and disease characteristics of patients who underwent RALPs in this study. There was no significant difference in patient demographics (age, BMI), pre-operative parameters (PSA level, prostate volume, haemoglobin level), or disease characteristics (ISUP grade group, pathological stage) between trainee-lead cases and specialist-lead cases.

Table II demonstrates operative parameters and peri-operative outcomes of patients in this study. There was no significant difference in operative parameters (robotic console time and frequency and degree of PLND) and peri-operative outcomes (intra-operative adverse events, estimated total blood loss, blood transfusion requirement, post-operative intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, duration of hospital admission, readmissions post discharge, duration of indwelling catheter use, and frequency of CD complications). Intra-operative adverse events occurred in two cases. These events were a caecal injury in a specialist-lead case (n=1) and intra-operative blood loss of 1.5 litres in a trainee-lead case (n=1). One patient in the specialist-lead group required ICU admission post-operatively. This patient represented 3 weeks post-operatively with bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli and required intensive care.

The overall post-operative complication rate was 23%, of which 9.5% were CD1, 8.7% CD2, 3.2% CD3b, and 1.6% CD4a complications. There were no CD5 complications. Grade 1-2 complications in the trainee-lead group consisted of constipation, atelectasis, suprapubic pain, wound site ooze (n=2), and low-grade fever. The grade 3b complication in the trainee-lead group was an infected lymphocele requiring intravenous antibiotics. Grade 1-2 complications in the specialist-lead group consisted of constipation (n=2), abdominal pain (n=3), nausea, reduced mobility, haematuria (n=2), hypotension, syncope, urinary tract infection (n=2), seroma, anaemia, blocked indwelling catheter, and bladder spasm. Grade 3b complications included a wound infection requiring drainage and anastomotic leak (n=2), one with urosepsis. Grade 4a complications in the specialist-lead group included right middle cerebral infarct and pancreatitis with systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

**Discussion**

The integration of robotic systems in urology has surged in recent years [15]. Exposure of urology trainees to robotic surgery is becoming increasingly important. Our study compared the outcomes of trainee-lead RALP with specialist-lead RALP at a high-volume robotic centre in Australia to assess whether specialist supervision through the dual console can provide high-quality robotic training without compromising patient outcomes. Our study of 126 RALPs found no significant difference in operative or pathological outcomes between trainee-lead and specialist-lead cases. We thereby demonstrate that with appropriate case selection, modular training for RALP is safe and does not compromise patient outcomes. Case selection in our study was informed by trainee experience and operative skill. Despite no statistically significant difference in pre-operative parameters and disease profile between groups in our study, specialists likely undertook the more technically challenging cases. This approach reflects real-world practice of appropriate case selection in a surgical training environment.

The peri-operative and pathological outcomes of trainee-lead RALP at Nepean Hospital are comparable with both local and international benchmarks [7–9,16] (Table IV). Our data compares favourably in terms of case volume, pre-operative parameters, estimated total blood loss, Clavien-Dindo complications, and surgical margins. RALPs in other studies were performed by robotic surgeons with significant experience, usually a 2-year robotic fellowship and at least 200 RALPs performed [6–9,14]. This experience is comparable to the experience of specialists in our study.

When comparing our results with similar international studies, we must note that few of these international studies were randomised or well-designed comparative studies. Most were cohort studies with high degree of heterogeneity [7,9,10]. Further, few studies primarily examined RALP outcomes. The larger studies showed marked improvement in outcomes when accounting for surgeon experience level. Cathcart et al. concluded that complication rates reduced after performing between 170 and 200 RALPs. In addition, many studies noted difficulties in correlating complication rates due to the variability in grading methods. The Clavien-Dindo system was not used consistently to score complication rates [8,10], which most likely accounts for a higher grade 1-2 complication rate in our study.

Our study focused on peri-operative and pathological outcomes only. We did not examine functional outcomes, owing to difficulties with data collection and the heterogeneous nature of functional data. While acknowledging this limitation, we provide a valuable assessment of the effect of trainee involvement in RALP by dual console on operative outcomes.

Another limitation in our study is the contribution of a trainee to steps in specialist lead cases. RALPs were classified as ‘trainee-lead’ if the trainee completed > 75% of the total operative steps. However, trainees completed between 0 and 38% of operative steps in consultant-lead cases. Trainee contributions to specialist-lead cases may contribute to the comparable pathological and operative outcomes between specialist-lead and trainee-lead cases demonstrated in our study. However, the majority of trainee contributions in specialist-lead cases are in the early steps of the case, of which a number are not highly technical. The small involvement of trainees in specialist-lead cases in our study reflects real-world training environments. These specialist-lead cases serve as an appropriate comparison to examine the impact of operative progression of trainees on patient outcomes in surgical training institutions.

Incorporating robotic training within surgical disciplines presents challenges not only for trainees but also for surgical educators. The dual console is a significant advancement addressing these challenges [14]. The modular training approach provides surgical trainees exposure to RALP while facilitating real-time guidance and intervention from specialists. Crucially, this setup permits a seamless transfer of device control with minimal tissue manipulation between operators. A recent qualitative study by Green et al. recommended the dual console in robotic training as it enables competency-based learning and graded autonomy with appropriate verbal guidance [17].

This study demonstrates that well-supervised trainees can produce comparable surgical and oncological outcomes in RALP to specialist-lead cases. In this era of increasing robotic surgery, learning curves for RALP and urological robotic surgeries can be initiated and improvised early in a surgical trainee’s career [17,18]. Further, a formalised robotic curriculum should be created and incorporated as part of the Australian Surgical Education and Training Program. Such a modular curriculum may shorten the learning curve in robotic surgery without compromising patient outcomes [18].

**Conclusion**

RALP can be performed by urology trainees with equivalent peri-operative and pathological outcomes when compared to operations performed by consultants. This is achieved by appropriate case selection, close supervision, and graded progression.
