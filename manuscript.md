**Abstract**

**Background and objective:** Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is integral to modern surgical practices, offering several advantages over traditional open surgery. The emergence of augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) technologies notably improved the surgical accuracy and safety of MIS. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of AR and MR applications in MIS, identifying key trends and assessing the overall impact of these technologies on surgical practices.

**Methods:** We systematically searched the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) for literature published between January 1, 1982, and August 14, 2024, using the keywords AR, MR and MIS. The search identified 1,635 publications, of which 310 papers and reviews met the screening criteria. Bibliometric techniques were employed to analyze publication trends, country/region and institution participation, authorship, journal distribution, citation patterns and research hotspots.

**Results:** The annual publication rate has shown a steady upward trend since 2006, peaking at 50 publications in 2022. The United States, China and Germany were the leading countries. Top institutions included Johns Hopkins University and Imperial College London. The International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery had the highest publication count, while Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques received the most citations. Key research hotspots focused on spinal and liver surgeries, particularly in computer-assisted surgery and image-guided techniques, with advancements in integrating AR and MR with robotic systems, 3D printing, and machine learning.

**Conclusion:** AR and MR technologies are increasingly used in MIS, especially in the enhancement of surgical navigation systems. This study provides insights for future research directions and practical applications in MIS.

1. **INTRODUCTION**

Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) represents a significant advancement in the field of surgical techniques, fundamentally changing the way surgeries are performed [1, 2]. It offers patients a minimally invasive treatment alternative while ensuring surgical precision, which helps reduce post-operative pain, speed up the recovery process, and reduce the risk of complications [3, 4]. Over the decades, MIS has gained widespread acceptance compared to traditional open surgery. With the continuous advancement of MIS technologies such as laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery, minimally invasive surgery has established itself in modern surgical practice, significantly improving patient outcomes and quality of life [5].

Augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) are two cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to further enhance MIS [6]. By projecting digital information, such as images or data, onto the real world, AR enables surgeons to access critical information without distracting from the surgical area [7]. MR technology combines the real world with virtual elements, allowing users to interact with both in real time [8]. In MIS, AR and MR applications show significant potential to improve surgical accuracy, enhance intraoperative decision making, and improve overall safety [9, 10]. These technologies enhance anatomical visualization, provide real-time guidance, and offer interactive tools that improve the precision of MIS [11].

Several studies have explored the applications of AR and MR in surgery, and the results highlight the potential of these techniques to improve surgical outcomes in terms of preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. For instance, Wang et al. [6] developed an AR-assisted soft tissue deformation-tracking navigation system for laparoscopic kidney surgery. The system utilizes preoperative imaging and binocular laparoscopy without the need for additional hardware. The experimental results show that the system has high precision and possesses the potential to enhance the clinical application of kidney surgery. Deng et al. [12] combined augmented reality navigation with indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging for left hemihepatectomy in patients with laparoscopic intrahepatic bile duct stones, indicating that this method could improve the safety and accuracy of the surgery. In the field of MR, research by Ryu et al. [13] has shown that the use of MR in laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery can enhance recognition of the anatomical structure and reduce surgeon fatigue. Zhang et al. [14] found that MR combined with indomyanine green fluorescence imaging real-time navigation can significantly reduce blood loss and shorten hospital stay during laparoscopic hepatectomy.

Despite the progress made, challenges remain, particularly the difficulty in identifying the most promising research directions. A comprehensive review of the existing research is helpful to find research hotspots and future development paths, and solve some of the existing problems [15]. While there are several reviews on this topic, they typically do not employ a bibliometric approach, leading to limitations such as small sample sizes, short follow-up times, and variability in assessment techniques [16-18]. Therefore, it is essential to carry out a bibliometric analysis on the application of AR and MR in MIS, which can point out the cooperation relationship, hotspots, etc., and help determine the future research direction [19, 20].

In this study, we aim to address the limitations of previous studies through bibliometrics methods and systematically analyze the existing literature on the application of AR and MR in MIS (Fig.1). This study can identify patterns and gaps in the research, enabling a more complete understanding of how AR and MR are being applied in minimally invasive surgery, and provide further evidence for future research and practical application in the field [21].

1. **MATERIALS AND METHODS**

**2.1. Data source and searching strategy**

Data for this study were sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), a recognized high-impact scientific literature database [22]. Keywords "Augmented Reality," "AR," "Mixed Reality," "MR," "Minimally Invasive Surgery," and "MIS" were utilized to conduct searches from January 1, 1982, to August 14, 2024, with the final search being performed on August 14, 2024. The search strategy is shown in Table 1.

**2.2. Study selection and eligible criteria**

According to PRISMA guidelines, two reviewers independently screened the title and abstract of a potential study to find duplications [23]. Subsequently, the full text was carefully reviewed to determine eligibility according to our predefined criteria (Table 2). The differences between the two reviewers were settled by discussion between the other two.

**2.3. Data analyses**

The bibliometric package (version 0.3 [24]) was utilized to extract relevant data from publications and perform a comprehensive statistical analysis. The polynomial regression model (Formula 1) was used to predict the future publishing trend. VOSviewer (version 1.6.20) was used to visualize collaborative networks [25]. CiteSpace (version 6.3.R1 Demo) was used to cluster cited journals, create a timeline view of cited references, and discover the latest references and keyword hot spots [26]. Parameter settings of CiteSpace were as follows: Link retention factor was set to 2.5, top N parameter was configured with e = 1.0, the time frame spanned from 2014 to 2024, with annual slices, and the look-back years were set to 5. Links were defined by cosine similarity within each slice, and selection criteria based on the g-index were applied, with k = 15. Only terms spanning at least one year were included.

Where x presents year minus 1996, p and n were parameters used to fit the curve.

1. **RESULTS**

**3.1. Data retrieval**

A preliminary search found 1635 publications. Using predefined eligibility criteria, we identified 310 publications from our subsequent analysis, including 211 articles and 99 reviews (Fig.2). The characteristics of the included studies were presented in Supplementary Table 1.

**3.2. Annual growth trend of publications**

Fig.3 illustrated a steady increase in the annual publication rate since 2006, peaking at 50 publications in 2022, with an average growth rate of 12.98%. Due to the incomplete data in 2024, regression analysis was conducted up to 2023, yielding the following equation: y = 0.0004x3 - 0.0855x2 + 0.8328x - 1.1333. This analysis showed a strong correlation between the year of publication and the number of publications (R² = 0.8434) [27]. At least 43 publications are expected to be published by 2024, while the actual number is likely to be higher, highlighting the growing interest and potential of AR and MR in MIS.

**3.3. Countries/regions and institutions analysis**

Among the 310 studies, we identified contributions from 42 countries. The United States (n = 66), China (n = 37) and Germany (n = 34) produced the most publications. The literature count included all articles with at least one author from each country, even those with cross-border collaborations, leading to the total higher than 310 (Fig.4a).

In terms of global cooperation, Fig.4b revealed strong collaboration between countries. In the field of international cooperation, the United States had the closest cooperation with others, while Germany, Italy and China being the top three partners. China's cooperation frequency was lower than that of Germany, both in terms of the number of partners and the intensity of cooperation,

The 310 selected documents were from 168 institutions, and the top 10 institutions accounted for 66 (21.29%). Johns Hopkins University ranked first (n = 23), followed by Imperial College London (n = 22) and the University of London (n = 21) (Fig.4c).

Fig.4d exhibited limited collaboration between institutions, with no central leader in the field. Technical University of Munich showed the highest collaborative effort, followed closely by Johns Hopkins University, highlighting the need to strengthen interinstitutional collaboration to stimulate the development in the field.

**3.4. Authors and co-cited authors analysis**

More than 1,597 researchers have contributed to AR and MR applications in MIS. The top three authors in terms of number of publications were Navab N (n = 13), Marescaux J (n = 8) and Porpiglia F (n = 8) (Fig.5a). While the most cited was Soler L (n = 61), followed by Marescaux J (n = 42) and Nachabe R (n = 40) (Fig.5b). Navab N, Marescaux J and Porpiglia F also ranked in the top 3 for local influence (Table 3). In addition, strong co-authorship and co-citation networks were observed, with high-yielding authors showing more connections, such as Navab N and Porpiglia F (Fig.5c). VOSviewer software was used to analyze the co-cited author network structure, as shown in Fig.5d. The authors were divided into four distinct groups, with very close co-citation relationships among them and there was a most pronounced co-citation relationship between Porpiglia F and Checcucci E.

**3.5. Journals and co-cited journals analysis**

A total of 901 academic journals have published research related to AR and MR applications in MIS. *International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery* (n = 24) ranked first, followed by *Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques* (n = 14) and *the International Journal of Medical Robotics and Robotics Computer Assisted Surgery* (n = 7) (Fig.6a).

The most cited journals were *Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques* (n = 521), *Lectures Notes in Computer Science* (n = 429), and *International Journal of Computer-Assisted Radiology and Surgery* (n = 346) (Fig. 6b). The top three influential journals were I*nternational Journal of Computer-Assisted Radiology and Surgery*, *Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques*, and *Computer Medical Imaging and Graphics* (Table 4). Furthermore, a co-cited relationship was also detected among these journals. *Lecture Notes in Computer Science* and *Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques* had the strongest co-cited relationships with other journals (Fig.6c).

Through the analysis of the number of published articles in journals, the top ten journals with the largest number of published articles were identified, and it can be noted that the number of publications was increasing, especially *the International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery* and *Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques*. In addition, it highlighted the shift in focus from imaging and graphics to computer-assisted radiology and surgery, underscoring the dynamic nature of research interests (Fig.6d).

The cluster analysis identified six major categories in the journal literature: "#0 clinical neurology," "#1 medicine general & internal," "#2 urology & nephrology," "#3 surgery," "#4 robotics" and "#5 neurosciences". These clusters reflected the core research areas within the field (Fig.6e).

**3.6. Co-cited references analysis**

Among the 12,045 cited literature analyzed in this study, ten most cited studies were shown in Table 5. Among them, Nicolau S et al. [28] (n = 28), Su LM et al. [29] (n = 23) and Bernhardt S et al. [30] (n = 21) ranked the top three cited literature (Table 5). Co-cited reference network in timeline view revealed 11 main clusters: "#0 spine surgery," "#1 molecular imaging," "#2 three-dimensional," "#3 instruments," "#4 electromagnetic tracking," "#5 arterovenous malformation," "#6 image-guided simulation," "#7 bayesian theory," "#9 surface reconstruction," "#11 discectomy" and "#13 endoscopy". Cluster "#11 discectomy" appeared closest on the timeline (Fig.7a).

Citation bursts indicated that a reference has been widely cited over time and that the findings of that reference were well known in the field [31]. From the top 20 references with the strongest citation bursts, Molina CA et al. [32], Liu A et al. [33], Ghaednia H et al. [34] and Burström G et al. [35] represented the highly cited literature in recent time, indicated that neurosurgery and spinal surgery has become a prominent focus in AR and MR research (Fig.7b).

**3.7. Keywords analysis**

By constructing the keyword network, we found that AR has garnered more attention than MR in MIS. Other notable keywords included "navigation," "robotic surgery," "registration," "surgical navigation," "accuracy," "laparoscopy," etc., which represent research priorities in this area (Fig.8a). The top 20 keywords with the strongest citation bursts were shown in Fig.8b. Keywords burst after 2019 include "Pedicle screw," "Experience," "Learning curve," "Minimally invasive spine surgery," "Liver surgery," "Augmented reality (AR)," "Mixed reality," "Spine surgery," "Pedicle screw placement," "Fusion," "Feasibility" and "Technique" (Fig.8b).

It can be noted that spinal and liver surgery have recently become a focus area in this field. In augmented reality and mixed reality technology, the integration of robotics and technologies such as 3D printing and machine learning is enhancing surgical navigation systems. The learning curve used to evaluate model performance across training and validation sets plays an important role in this advancement. The overall goal is to achieve "computer-assisted surgery" through image-guided technology, which marks the next major goal in the field.

1. **DISCUSSION**
   1. **General information**

This study systematically reviews all previously published studies on AR and MR in MIS from 1982 to 2024, which were collected by the Web of Science Core Collection. After applying established screening criteria, we performed a bibliometric analysis of 310 publications in 168 journals between 1997 and 2024 from 490 institutions in 42 countries, involving 1,597 authors, and obtaining 12,045 co-cited references.

While research on AR and MR in MIS emerged later than other technologies, their high practicality has led to a steady increase in the number of studies in recent years [36, 37]. The annual production trend of AR and MR in MIS has shown a clear upward trend, reflecting consistent growth in line with statistical predictions. While there is significant international cooperations, cooperation among agencies remains relatively fragmented. The United States emerged as the largest contributor, followed by Germany and China, a distribution that likely reflected each country's advances in science and medicine [38, 39].

Navab N was considered one of the most influential scholars in the field, with research interests covering medical augmented reality, computer-assisted surgery, medical robotics, computer vision, and machine learning [40, 41]. His significant academic impact, recognized by numerous awards, may be attributed to his extensive collaborations with other prominent authors in part, enlightening researchers on the importance of communication.

The most relevant journals suggested that the central areas of AR and MR in MIS include radiology, surgical endoscopy and other interventional techniques, medical robotics and computer-assisted surgery, computer methods and procedures, imaging and graphics, neurosurgery, spinal surgery, etc [42-44]. These areas represent the intersection of medicine and digital technologies, indicating the future direction of surgical innovation. An analysis of "Journal's Production over Time" highlights a shift in focus from imaging and graphics to computer-assisted radiology and surgery. This temporal progression underscores the dynamic nature of research interest and can guide future investigative work in the field [45]. The journal with the strongest co-citation relationship with other journals not only indicates that it is closely related to other journals in academic research, but also indicates that it may be the core journal in the field [46, 47], and is more inclined to cover similar research topics with other journals. In addition, its content has certain reference value for researchers in multidisciplinary fields. A cluster analysis map of co-cited journal subjects shows that neuroscience, urology and nephrology may also have an important place in this field.

The top 20 most-cited literature shows that laparoscopic surgery has been a key area of attention, while the timeline and the top 20 most-cited literature show that spinal surgery has recently received a great deal of attention. Frequently cited keywords from 2019, such as "Pedicle screw," "Learning curve," "Minimally invasive spinal surgery," and "Augmented reality," further highlight these changing research priorities [48].

Spinal surgery, followed by laparoscopic surgery and neurosurgery, has become a key focus of AR and MR research. Analyzing these disciplines revealed common features, such as identifiable anatomical markers, which contribute to the effectiveness of surgical navigation systems [49]. The combination of AR and MR with robotics, as well as technologies such as 3D printing and machine learning, are enhancing surgical navigation systems [50]. The realization of "computer-assisted surgery" through image-guided technology is the main goal of continued development in this field.

* 1. **Research Hotspots**

The journal ranking analysis identified key disciplines for AR and MR applications in minimally invasive surgery, including radiology, surgical endoscopy, interventional techniques, medical robotics, computer-assisted surgery, computer methods and procedures, imaging and graphics, neurosurgery, and spinal surgery. The "Journal's Production over Time" analysis highlights a shift in research focus from imaging and graphics to computer-assisted radiology and surgery, reflecting technological advances and the medical community's ongoing commitment to improving surgical precision and safety.

A cluster analysis of journal titles shows six major study categories, including "#0 invasive spinal surgery," "#1 medicine general & internal," "#2 urology & nephrology," "#3 surgery," "#4 robotics" and "#5 neurosciences", highlighting areas of focus. The most cited publications indicate that spinal surgery is an emerging focus, underscoring the growing emphasis on specific surgical methods and the need for continuous improvement.

Since 2019, the most frequently cited keywords—including "Pedicle screw," "Experience," "Learning curve," "Minimally invasive spine surgery," "Liver surgery," "Augmented reality (AR)," "Mixed reality," "Spine surgery," "Pedicle screw placement," "Fusion," "Feasibility" and "Technique"—reflect current research priorities and the trajectory of future technological development [26]. Spine surgery, in particular, has been a compelling field, driven by advances in surgical navigation systems that integrate technologies such as 3D printing and machine learning to support "computer-assisted surgery" [51-53]. These developments are expected to significantly improve surgical accuracy, safety, and patient outcomes.

In addition, the keyword "Pedicle screw", an internal fixation device used to provide three-dimensional stability of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in spinal surgery [54], has received increasing attention. The burst of this keyword further confirms that spinal surgery is a key frontier in AR and MR research.

Interdisciplinary collaborations are driving the advancement of AR and MR technologies, with the goal of integrating their applications into clinical practice [55]. This effort not only represents scientific progress, but also demonstrates a commitment to improving human health and quality of life through cutting-edge medical innovation.

* 1. **Strengths and limitations**

This study is a preliminary attempt to systematically analyze the literature and trends of AR and MR applications in MIS. A comprehensive search strategy was employed to retrieve a wide range of relevant documents, followed by manual verification and selection to ensure that only documents that meet the expected standards are included. The method aims to strike a balance between recall and precision to enhance the representativeness of the results. The scope of the article analysis is broad, covering various research stages and providing a multi-faceted view of the field. In addition, a series of bibliometric tools are used to explore research hotspots from different perspectives, providing detailed reference for clinicians and scholars.

However, some limitations must be acknowledged. First, the dataset was only sourced from WoSCC, excluding other major databases such as Embase and PubMed, which may have led to the omission of relevant studies. In addition, the analysis was limited to English language publications, which may have linguistic biases. Finally, while the manual selection process is thorough, it may introduce a degree of subjectivity, which means that the selected articles may not fully capture the breadth of applications of AR and MR in minimally invasive surgery.

1. **CONCLUSION**

Recent advances in AR and MR technologies have significantly impacted MIS, garnering considerable attention. Current research advances are focused on the use of robotic systems for AR and MR, as well as other emerging technologies, such as 3D printing and machine learning, to enhance surgical navigation systems. The ultimate goal is to achieve "computer-assisted surgery" through the implementation of image-guided procedures, especially in the field of spinal surgery.
