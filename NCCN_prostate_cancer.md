NCCN Guidelines Index
Table of Contents
Discussion

Updates in Version 1.2025 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2024 include:
GLOBAL
• References have been updated throughout the Guidelines.
• The word "conventional" has been removed throughout the Guidelines in regards to imaging techniques. It has been replaced with specific imaging modalities (eg, CT,

MRI, bone scan).

• Footnote removed from algorithm pages: Because of the increased sensitivity and specificity of PSMA-PET tracers for detecting micrometastatic disease compared to
conventional imaging (eg, CT, bone scan) at both initial staging and BCR, the panel does not feel that conventional imaging is a necessary prerequisite to PSMA-PET
and that PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI can serve as an equally effective, if not more effective frontline imaging tool for these patients.

• Footnotes regarding use of biosimilars for specific regimens have been replaced by the general footnote: An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for

any recommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines.

• F-18 fluciclovine has been removed from the Guidelines.
PROS-1
• Workup for regional or metastatic prostate cancer, bullet 2 modified: Perform bone and soft tissue imaging for staging
• Footnote removed: Bone imaging can be achieved by conventional technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scan. CT, MRI, prostate-specific

membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI, or PET/CT or PET/ MRI with F-18 sodium fluoride, or C-11 choline, or F-18 fluciclovine can be considered
for equivocal results on initial bone imaging. Soft tissue imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest can include chest CT and abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic
MRI. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is preferred over CT for pelvic staging. Alternatively, PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI can be considered for bone and soft tissue
(full body) imaging. See Principles of Imaging (PROS-E). (also for PROS-2A)

PROS-2
• Clinical Pathologic Features
High risk group modified:

 ◊ Has no very high risk features and has exactly one high risk feature Has one or more high-risk features, but does not meet criteria for very high risk

 – cT3–cT4 cT3a or
 – Grade Group 4 or Grade Group 5 or
 – PSA >20 ng/mL

Very high risk group modified:

 ◊ Has at least one two of the following:

 – cT3b-cT4
 – >4 cores with Grade Group 4 or 5
 – PSA >40 ng/mL
 – Primary Gleason pattern 5
 – 2 or 3 high-risk features

• Additional Evaluation, Unfavorable Intermediate risk, bullet modified: Bone and sSoft tissue imaging and consider bone imaging
PROS-2A
• Footnote k, second sentence added: The Panel considers biospies from a single region of interest (ROI) to count as a single sample.
PROS-4
• For life expectancy ≥10 y, the radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy pathways were extensively revised.
• Footnote dd removed from the page. (Also for PROS-5 and PROS-6)
PROS-5
• The radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy pathways were extensively revised. (Also for PROS-6)
• The use of PLND with RP was removed from the algorithm pages. PLND recommendations are found on PROS-J. (also for PROS-6 through PROS-8)

• For life expectancy  ≤5 y and asymptomatic, initial therapy was modified to: Observation or RT or ADT ± RT; Symptomatic Progression.
PROS-8A
• Footnote z modified: For details on the use of ADT and other hormonal agents, including information on their efficacy and safety, see Principles of Androgen

Deprivation Therapy (PROS-G) and Discussion. (Also for PROS-10A, PROS-11A, PROS-12, PROS-13C, PROS-14, PROS-15, PROS-16A)

• Footnote dd modified: Monitoring is not preferred for patients with positive nodes or multiple high-risk features.
• The following footnotes were removed:
For patients with pN1 diseae and PSA persistence, see PROS-10.
See monitoring for N1 on ADT (PROS-9).
PSA nadir is the lowest value reached after EBRT or brachytherapy.
Patients in STAMPEDE had as least two of the following: cT3-4, Grade Group 4 or 5, and PSA >40 ng/mL.
ADT or EBRT may be considered in selected patients with high- or very-high-risk disease, where complications, such as hydronephrosis or metastasis, can be

expected within 5 years.

Abiraterone with ADT should be considered for a total of 2 years for those patients with N1 disease who are treated with radiation to the prostate and pelvic lymph

nodes (PROS-G).

PROS-9A
• Footnote hh modified: ...and soft tissue evaluation.  Bone imaging can be achieved by conventional technetium-99m MDP bone scan. CT, MRI, PSMA-PET/CT or

PSMA-PET/MRI, or PET/CT or PET/MRI with F-18 sodium fluoride, or C-11 choline, or F-18 fluciclovine can be considered for equivocal results on initial bone imaging.
Soft tissue imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest can include chest CT and abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI. Alternatively, PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-
PET/MRI can be considered for bone and soft tissue (full body) imaging. See Principles of Imaging (PROS-E). (Also for PROS-10A, -11A, -12, -13A, -14)

• Footnote ii modified: Treatment of patients with life expectancy ≤ 5 y whose cancer progressed on observation of localized disease is ADT.
PROS-10
• Radical Prostatectomy PSA Persistence/Recurrence, life expectancy >5 y:
Bullet 1, sub-bullet removed: PSADT and PSA level.
Bullet 3 modified: Prostate bed biopsy (especially if imaging suggests local recurrence)
• Treatment for PSA Persistence/Recurrence, studies positive for pelvic nodal recurrence, regimen modified: EBRT + ADT + abiraterone (category 2B)
PROS-10A
• Footnote ii added to the page: Treatment of patients with life expectancy ≤ 5 y whose cancer progressed on observation of localized disease is ADT. (Also for PROS-

11A)

• Footnote jj added: Recommendations for RP PSA persistence/recurrence may also apply to patients with undetectable PSA with multiple adverse features or lymph

node metastases if treatment is being considered.

• Footnote removed: PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI are preferred for bone and soft tissue (full body) imaging. Alternatively, bone imaging can be achieved by

conventional technetium-99m-MDP bone scan. CT, MRI, PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI, or PET/CT or PET/MRI with F-18 sodium fluoride, or C-11 choline, or
F-18 fluciclovine can be considered for equivocal results on initial bone imaging. Soft tissue imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest can include chest CT and
abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI. mpMRI is preferred over CT for pelvic staging and its use is recommended in addition to PSMA-PET in the setting of RT
recurrence. See Principles of Imaging (PROS-E). (Also for PROS-11A)

expectancy ≤5 years. (Also for PROS-15)

PROS-15
• Page header modified: Workup and Treatment of Systemic Therpy For M1 CRPC
• Workup
Bullet 2 modified: Somatic testing for homologous recombination repair (HRR), microsatellite instability/mismatch repair deficiency (MSI/dMMR), and tumor

mutational burden (TMB) if not previously done.

Sub-bullet 1 added: Recommended if not previously done.
Sub-bullet 2 added: Re-evaluation may be considered.
• Footnote eee modified: ...occurs on ADT. Workup for progression should include chest CT, bone imaging, andd abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast or abdominal/pelvic

MRI with and without contrast.

• Footnote ggg modified: Cabazitaxel 20 or 25 mg/m2 plus carboplatin area under the curve [AUC] 4 mg/mL per min with growth factor support can be considered for fit

patients with aggressive variant prosate cancer metastatic CRPC (mCRPC)...(Language also changed on PROS-L [2 of 4]).

PROS-16
• No prior docetaxel/no prior novel hormone therapy, preferred regimens, bullet 1 footnote removed and text modified: Abiraterone (category 1 if no visceral metastases).
• Progression on prior novel hormone therapy/no prior docetaxel: Useful in certain circumtances, bullet 4 modified: Pembrolizumab for MSI-H/dMMR or TMB ≥10 mut/

mB.

• Progression on prior docetaxel and a novel hormone therapy, Useful in certain circumstances, bullet 4 modified: Olaparib for HRR mutation

(category 1 for BRCA mutation.)

PROS-16A
• Footnote kkk added: Pan-cancer, tumor-agnostic treatments can be considered for patients with actionable mutations.
• Footnote hhh modified: Document castrate levels of testosterone if progression occurs on ADT. Workup for progression should include chest CT, bone imaging, and
abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast or abdominal/pelvic MRI with and without contrast. Consider metastatic lesion biopsy. If small cell neuroendocrine is found, see
PROS-15. See Principles of Imaging (PROS-E) and Discussion.

• Footnote nnn added: PARP inhibitors with or without novel hormone therapy have different biomarker and previous treatment requirements. See Principles of Non-

Hormonal Systemic Therapy (PROS-L).

• Footnote ooo modified: Niraparib plus abiraterone (combination tablet) is a treatment option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation

(germline and/or somatic) who have not yet had treatment in the setting of mCRPC, depending on prior treatment in other disease settings (PROS-16). Use of
niraparib/abiraterone for those who have received prior novel hormone therapy is controversial because a benefit of this combination over use of a PARP inhibitor
alone has not been shown in this setting, but responses are likely. The fine-particle (category 2B; other recommended option) or standard formulation of abiraterone
can be given with single-agent niraparib as a substitute for the combination niraparib/abiraterone tablet (category 2B; other recommended option). (Language also
changed on PROS-L [4 of 4]).

Discussion

Updates in Version 1.2025 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2024 include:

PROS-16A (continued)
• Footnote removed: Talazoparib plus enzalutamide is a treatment option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in an HRR gene
(BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, ATR, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, MLH1, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, or RAD51C) who have not yet had treatment in the setting of CRPC, depending
on prior treatment in other disease settings (PROS-16). There may be heterogeneity of response based on the specific gene mutation (Discussion). Use of talazoparib/
enzalutamide for those who have received prior novel hormone therapy is controversial because a benefit of this combination over use of a PARP inhibitor alone has
not been shown in this setting, but responses are likely.

• Footnote removed: The noted category applies only if there are no visceral metastases.
• Footnote removed: Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m² plus carboplatin AUC 4 mg/mL per min with growth factor support can be considered for fit patients with aggressive variant
prostate cancer (ie, visceral metastases, low PSA and bulky disease, high LDH, high CEA, lytic bone metastases, NEPC histology) or unfavorable genomics (defects
in at least 2 of PTEN, TP53, and RB1). Corn PG, et al. Lancet Oncol 2019;20:1432-1443.

• Footnote removed: Olaparib is a treatment option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in a HRR gene (BRCA1, BRCA2,

ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L) who have been treated previously with androgen receptor-
directed therapy. However, efficacy appears to be driven by the cohort of patients with at least one alteration in BRCA2, BRCA1, or ATM, and in particular by patients
with BRCA2 or BRCA1 mutations based on exploratory gene-by-gene analysis. There may be heterogeneity of response to olaparib for non-BRCA mutations based on
the specific gene mutation (Discussion).

• Footnote removed: Other secondary hormone therapies include abiraterone, fine-particle abiraterone, and enzalutamide for patients with disease progression on

prior novel hormone therapy. In addition, switching from prednisone or methylprednisolone to dexamethasone 1 mg/day can be considered for patients with disease
progression on either formulation of abiraterone. Also see Principles of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (PROS-G).

• Footnote removed: Rucaparib is a treatment option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been

treated with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy. If the patient is not fit for chemotherapy, rucaparib can be considered even if
taxane-based therapy has not been given.

• Footnote removed: Olaparib with abiraterone is an option for patients with a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA1 mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have not yet

received a novel hormone therapy and who have not yet had treatment in the setting or CRPC.

PROS-A
• Bullet 3, sub-bullet 4 added: University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Lee Schonberg Index (https://eprognosis.ucsf.educ/leeschonberg.php).
PROS-C (1 of 2)
• Pre-test considerations, bullet 1, sentence 2 modified: Criteria for germline testing ... and LS-1 HRS-3 ...
• Germline testing; Pre-test Considerations, sub-bullet 2 added: Germline testing is also recommended for patients with metastatic, regional (node positive), very-high-

risk localized, or high-risk localized prostate-cancer.

• Testing, sub-bullet modified: If criteria are met, germline multigene testing is recommended (see GENE-1 in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk

Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate. that includes at least BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALD2, CHEK2, HOXB13, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is
recommended.
PROS-C (2 of 2)
• Somatic tumor testing; Pre-test considerations, Bullet 1, first sentence modified: At present tumor molecular and biomarker analysis may be used is recommended for
patients with metastatic disease for treatment decision-making, including understanding elibibility for biomarker-directed treatments, genetic counseling, early use of
platinum chemotherapy, and eligibility for clinical trials.

• Testing; Bullet 1, sub-bullets modfied:
Sub-bullet 1, sub-sub-bullet 1added: Loss of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be especially associated with response to PARP inhibitor therapy compared to other HRR

gene alterations

Sub-bullet 3 modified: TMB testing may be considered is recommended in patients with mCRPC.

Updates in Version 1.2025 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2024 include:

PROS-C (2 of 2) (continued)
• Tumor Specimen and Assay Considerations; Bullet 1, sub-bullet 1modified: When metastatic biopsy is unsafe or unfeasible, plasma circulating DNA (ctDNA) assay is

an option, preferably collected during biochemical (PSA) and/or radiographic progression in order to maximize diagnostic yield. When diagnostic yield is low, the risk of
false negatives is higher, so ctDNA collection is not recommended when PSA is undetectable.

Updates in Version 1.2025 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2024 include:

PROS-I (4 of 8)
• Table extensively revised. (Also for PROS-I [5 of 9])
• Footnote e added: Use of SBRT boost requires careful treatment planning, expertise, and strict adherence to constraints of the reference studies (Wegener E, et al.

Eur Urol Oncol 2024;S2588-9311; Pasquier D, et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2020;106:116-123).

• Footnote d, sentence 1 added: EBRT to whole prostate 2.2 Gy x 35 fx plus micro-boost to MRI-dominant lesion to ≤95 Gy (fractions ≤2.7 Gy).
PROS-I (6 of 8)
• Post-Prostatectomy Radiation Therapy
Bullet 3, sentence removed: The panel recommends consultation with the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)/American Urological Association (AUA)

Gudielines.

Bullet 4 modified: Typical prescribed doses for adjuvant RT or secondary post-prostatectomy RT for rising PSA are 64–72 Gy in standard fractionation. Biopsy-proven
and/or imaging-defined gross recurrence may require higher doses.Notably, randomized trial data for those without gross evident disease demonstrated no benefit
but higher physician-reported toxicity with dose escalation for 70 Gy versus 64 Gy. Treatment volumes and OAR tolerances thus should be carefully considered and
prioritized. Hypofractionated post-prostatectomy RT to the prostate fossa alone is supported by toxicity and outcome equipoise in post-hoc evaluation of the remains
under prospective study with data from large studies such as RADICALS-RT trial (52.5 Gy/20 fractions vs. 64 Gy/32 fractions 66 Gy/33 fractions) and in the 2-year
report of the NRG GU003 trial (62.5 Gy/25 fractions vs. 66.6 Gy/37 fractions). However, the Panel notes that these regimens have shorter follow-up than historically
studied conventionally fractionated regimens and a relative paucity of data for simultaneous integrated treatment of the pelvic lymph nodes. suggesting no excess
toxicity in post hoc comparison for at least fossa alone treatment.

PROS-J (1 of 2)
• Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection
Bullets have been reordered.
Bullet 1 added: For patients undergoing RP:

 ◊ Sub-bullet 1 added: Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) can be considered in patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.
 ◊ Sub-bullet 2 added: PLND is recommended in patients wtih unfavorable intermediate, high, very-high-risk, and regional prosate cancer.

• Radical Prostatectomy, bullet 1 modified: RP is an appropriate therapy for any patient not on an active surveillance program with clinically localized prostate cancer...
PROS-L (1 of 4)
• Non-Hormonal Systemic Therapy for M1 Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
Bullet 1 modified: Patients with low-volume synchronous or high-volume castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer who are fit for chemotherapy should be

considered for triplet therapy with ADT, certain androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs), and plus docetaxel and either abiraterone, or darolutamide based on
phase 3 studies:
 ◊ Sub-bullet 3 added: An open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial compared ADT with enzalutamide to ADT with a first-generation antiandrogen in this setting.

Concurrent docetaxel was allowed and used for stratification. OS was improved with the use of enzalutamide over first-generation antiandrogen regardless of the
addition of docetaxel. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia associated with docetaxel use (6% in both groups), fatigue (1% in the
control group vs. 6% in the enzalutamide group), and hypertension (6% vs. 10%). The incidence of grade 1–3 memory impairment was 4% versus 13%.

PROS-L (3 of 4)
• PARP Inhibitors With or Without Novel Hormone Therapies
Sub-bullet 1 added: Loss of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be especially associated with response to PARP inhibitor therapy compared to other HRR gene alterations.
Sub-bullet 2, sentence 2 added: Efficacy appears to be driven by the cohort of patients with at least one alteration in BRCA2, BRCA1, or ATM, and in particular
by patients with BRCA2 or BRCA1 mutations based on exploratory gene-by-gene analysis. There may be heterogeneity of response to olaparib for non-BRCA
mutations based on the specific gene mutation (Discussion).

Updates in Version 1.2025 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2024 include:

PROS-L (3 of 4)(continued)
Sub-bullet 3 modified: Rucaparib is an option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been

treated with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy based on results from a phase 2 trial. Results from the confirmatory randomized
phase 3 trial that showed that the median duration of imaging-based PFS was significantly longer in the group that received rucaparib than in those who received
a control medication (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or docetaxel). In the pre-docetaxel setting, rucaparib is a preferred option for patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutations. If the patient is not fit for chemotherapy, rucaparib can be considered even if taxane-based therapy has not been given. Adverse events that may
occur with rucaparib include anemia (including that requiring transfusion),fatigue, asthenia, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea  or constipation,
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, increased creatinine, increased liver transaminases, and rash. Rare but serious side effects of rucaparib include a theoretical risk of
myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia, as well as fetal teratogenicity.

Sub-bullet 4 modified: Olaparib with abiraterone is an option for certain patients with mCRPC (PROS-16) and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (germline

and/or somatic) who have not yet received a novel hormone therapy and who have not yet had treatment in the setting of CRPC based on results of an international,
double-blind, phase 3 trial. Imaging-based PFS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group. The
safety profile of the olaparib/abiraterone combination was as expected based on the known safety profiles of the individual drugs, with the most common adverse
events being anemia, fatigue/asthenia, and nausea.

f Principles of Imaging (PROS-E).
g Tumor-based molecular assays and germline genetic testing are other tools that can assist with risk stratification. See CRIT-6 in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/
Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate and HRS-3 in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal,
Endometrial, and Gastric to determine if a patient is an appropriate candidate for germline genetic testing, and see Principles of Risk Stratification and Biomarkers
(PROS-H) to determine if a patient is an appropriate candidate for tumor-based molecular assays.  to determine if a patient is an appropriate candidate for tumor-based
molecular assays.
h For patients who are asymptomatic in very-low-, low-, and intermediate-risk groups with life expectancy ≤5 years, no imaging or treatment is indicated until the patient
becomes symptomatic, at which time imaging can be performed [Principles of Imaging (PROS-E)] and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) should be given [Principles
of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (PROS-G)].
i An ultrasound-, MRI-, or DRE-targeted lesion that is biopsied more than once and demonstrates cancer (regardless of percentage core involvement or number of cores
involved) can be considered as a single positive core.
j Percentage of positive cores in the intermediate-risk group is based on biopsies that include systematic biopsies with or without targeted MRI-guided biopsies. The
Panel considers biopsies from a single region of interest (ROI) to count as a single sample.
k Bone imaging should be performed for any patient with symptoms consistent with bone metastases.

FOOTNOTES

c Principles of Bone Health in Prostate Cancer (PROS-B).
h For patients who are asymptomatic in very-low-, low-, and intermediate-risk
groups with life expectancy ≤5 years, no imaging or treatment is indicated until the
patient becomes symptomatic, at which time imaging can be performed [Principles
of Imaging (PROS-E)] and ADT should be given [Principles of Androgen
Deprivation Therapy (PROS-G)].
l Principles of Life Expectancy Estimation (PROS-A).
m The Panel remains concerned about the problems of overtreatment related
to the increased diagnosis of early prostate cancer from PSA testing. See
NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection. Active surveillance is
recommended for this subset of patients.
n Active surveillance involves actively monitoring the course of disease with the
expectation to intervene with potentially curative therapy if the cancer progresses.
See Principles of Active Surveillance and Observation (PROS-F).
o Confirmatory testing can be used to assess the appropriateness of active
surveillance (PROS-F 2 of 5). If higher grade and/or higher T stage is found during
confirmatory testing, see PROS-2.
p Observation involves monitoring the course of disease with the expectation
to deliver palliative therapy for the development of symptoms or a change in
examination or PSA that suggests symptoms are imminent. See Principles of
Active Surveillance and Observation (PROS-F).
q Criteria for progression are not well-defined and require physician judgment;
however, a change in risk group strongly implies disease progression. See
Discussion.
r The Panel recognizes that there is heterogeneity across the low-risk group, and
that some factors may be associated with an increased probability of near-term
grade reclassification, including high PSA density, a high number of positive cores
(eg, ≥3), high genomic risk (from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis), and/or a
known BRCA2 germline mutation. In some of these cases, upfront treatment with
RP or prostate RT may be preferred based on shared decision-making with the
patient. See Principles of Active Surveillance and Observation (PROS-F).
s Principles of Radiation Therapy (PROS-I).
t Principles of Surgery (PROS-J).

u RTOG-ASTRO (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group - American Society for
Radiation Oncology) Phoenix Consensus: 1) PSA increase by ≥2 ng/mL above the
nadir PSA is the standard definition for PSA recurrence after external beam RT
(EBRT) with or without hormone therapy; and 2) a recurrence evaluation should
be considered when PSA has been confirmed to be increasing after radiation even
if the increase above nadir is <2 ng/mL, especially in candidates for secondary
local therapy who are young and healthy. Retaining a strict version of the ASTRO
definition allows comparison with a large existing body of literature. Rapid increase
of PSA may warrant evaluation (prostate biopsy) prior to meeting the Phoenix
definition, especially in patients who are younger or healthier.
v PSA persistence/recurrence after RP is defined as when PSA does not fall to
undetectable levels (PSA persistence) or undetectable PSA after RP with a
subsequent detectable PSA that increases on ≥2 determinations (PSA recurrence)
or increases to PSA >0.1 ng/mL. Trials indicating non-inferiority of early RT
compared with adjuvant RT after RP have used a PSA threshold of 0.1 or 0.2
ng/mL to trigger treatment. Imaging and treatment at lower PSA levels may be
appropriate in patients at high risk for progression based on pretreatment risk
factors, pathologic parameters, timing of recurrence, and genomic classifier (GC)
score, among other factors.
w Adverse laboratory/pathologic features include: positive margin(s), seminal
vesicle invasion, extracapsular extension, or detectable PSA.
x Particular consideration to active surveillance may be appropriate for those
patients in the favorable intermediate-risk group with a low percentage of Gleason
pattern 4 cancer, low tumor volume, low PSA density, and/or low genomic
risk (from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis). See Principles of Active
Surveillance and Observation (PROS-F).
y Active surveillance of unfavorable intermediate and high-risk clinically localized
cancers is not recommended in patients with a life expectancy >10 years
(category 1).

bb  RP + pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) can be considered in patients who are

younger and healthier without tumor fixation to the pelvic sidewall.
cc Monitoring is not preferred for patients with multiple high-risk features.
dd There is limited evidence that RP + PLND is beneficial in the setting of node-
positive disease. Use of this approach should be limited to patients with >10-year
life expectancy and resectable disease and should be used in the context of a
clinical trial or planned multimodality approach.

MONITORING AND RECURRENCE
FOOTNOTES

f Principles of Imaging (PROS-E).
u RTOG-ASTRO Phoenix Consensus: 1) PSA increase by ≥2 ng/mL above the nadir PSA is the standard definition for PSA recurrence after EBRT with or without
hormone therapy; and 2) a recurrence evaluation should be considered when PSA has been confirmed to be increasing after radiation even if the increase above nadir
is <2 ng/mL, especially in candidates for secondary local therapy who are young and healthy. Retaining a strict version of the ASTRO definition allows comparison with
a large existing body of literature. Rapid increase of PSA may warrant evaluation (prostate biopsy) prior to meeting the Phoenix definition, especially in patients who
are younger or healthier.
v PSA persistence/recurrence after RP is defined as when PSA does not fall to undetectable levels (PSA persistence) or undetectable PSA after RP with a subsequent
detectable PSA that increases on ≥2 determinations (PSA recurrence) or increases to PSA >0.1 ng/mL. Trials indicating non-inferiority of early RT compared with
adjuvant RT after RP have used a PSA threshold of 0.1 or 0.2 ng/mL to trigger treatment. Imaging and treatment at lower PSA levels may be appropriate in patients at
high risk for progression based on pretreatment risk factors, pathologic parameters, timing of recurrence, and GC score, among other factors.
ee  PSA as frequently as every 3 mo may be necessary to clarify disease status, especially in patients at high risk of recurrence.
ff  Document castrate levels of testosterone if clinically indicated. Workup for progression should include bone and soft tissue evaluation.
gg Treatment for patients with life expectancy ≤5 y whose cancer progressed on observation of localized disease is ADT. See Principles of Androgen Deprivation
Therapy (PROS-G).

metastatic disease is preferred. PSADT and Grade Group should be considered
when deciding whether to begin ADT for patients with M0 disease. For ADT alone,
intermittent ADT can be considered to reduce toxicity.

pp Enzalutamide with or without leuprolide is an option for patients who have the
following high-risk criteria: M0 by CT, MRI, or bone scan; PSADT ≤9 months; PSA ≥2
ng/mL above nadir after RT or ≥1 ng/mL after RP with or without postoperative RT;
and not considered a candidate for pelvic-directed therapy (Freedland SJ, et al. N

qq Apalutamide plus ADT is an option for patients with biochemical recurrence after RP
who meet the following high-risk criteria: PSADT ≤9 months; PSA ≥0.5 ng/mL; and
prior adjuvant or secondary RT or not considered a candidate for RT (Aggarwal R, et
al. J Clin Oncol 2024;42:1114-1123.) See Principles of Androgen Deprivation Therapy

ff  Document castrate levels of testosterone if clinically indicated. Workup for progression should include bone and soft tissue evaluation.
rr  EBRT to sites of bone metastases can be considered if metastases are in weight-bearing bones or if the patient is symptomatic.
ss Stereotactic body RT (SBRT) to metastases can be considered in appropriate clinical situations. See Principles of Radiation Therapy (PROS-I).
tt  Bone antiresorptive therapy is indicated for elevated fracture risk based upon FRAX in the castration-sensitive setting. See PROS-B.
uu  T he term "castration-sensitive" is used to define disease in patients who have not been treated with ADT and those who are not on ADT at the time of progression.
The NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel uses the term "castration-sensitive" even when patients have had neoadjuvant, concurrent, or adjuvant ADT as part of RT
provided they have recovered testicular function.

vv ADT is strongly recommended in combination therapy for metastatic castration-sensitive disease. The use of ADT monotherapy in metastatic castration-sensitive
disease is discouraged unless there are clear contraindications to combination therapy. If ADT monotherapy is given, intermittent ADT can be considered to reduce
toxicity. See Principles of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (PROS-G).
ww  ADT alone (PROS-G) or observation are recommended for asymptomatic patients with metastatic disease or M0 CRPC and life expectancy ≤5 years.
xx High-volume disease in this setting is defined based on CHAARTED criteria (the presence of visceral metastasis or ≥4 bone lesions with ≥1 beyond the vertebral
bodies and pelvis).
yy EBRT to the primary tumor is associated with an overall survival (OS) benefit in patients with low metastatic burden at the time of diagnosis of metastatic disease,
which is defined by bone scan and CT or MRI as either non-regional, lymph-node-only disease OR <4 bone metastases and without visceral/other metastasis (Ali A, et
al. JAMA Oncol 2021;7:555-563). See Principles of Radiation Therapy (PROS-I).

PRINCIPLES OF LIFE EXPECTANCY ESTIMATION

• Life expectancy estimation is critical to informed decision-making in prostate cancer early detection and treatment.

• Estimation of life expectancy is possible for groups of patients but challenging for individuals.

• Life expectancy can be estimated using:
The Social Security Administration tables (www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table4c6.html)
The WHO’s Life Tables by country (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.60000?lang=en)
The Memorial Sloan Kettering Male Life Expectancy tool (https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate)
University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Lee Schonberg Index (https://eprognosis.ucsf.edu/leeschonberg.php)

• If using a life expectancy table, life expectancy should be adjusted using the clinician’s assessment of overall health as follows:
Best quartile of health - add 50%
Worst quartile of health - subtract 50%
Middle two quartiles of health - no adjustment

• Examples of upper, middle, and lower quartiles of life expectancy at selected ages are included in the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult

Oncology for life expectancy estimation.

PRINCIPLES OF BONE HEALTH IN PROSTATE CANCER

Treatment-Related Bone Loss
• ADT increases the risk of bone loss, and this risk is exacerbated with more

potent androgen suppression, longer duration of therapy or delayed testosterone
recovery, and concurrent prednisone use.

• The goal of osteoporosis screening is to identify patients at increased risk of

sustaining a low-trauma fracture who would benefit from intervention to minimize
the fracture risk. Risk assessment for treatment-related bone loss should take
place for all patients initiating ADT of any duration. Fracture risk can be assessed
using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX), the algorithm released by The
University of Sheffield (https://frax.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/). FRAX was developed to
estimate the 10-year probability of hip fracture or major osteoporotic fractures
combined (hip, spine, shoulder, or wrist) for an untreated individual using easily
obtainable clinical risk factors for fracture with or without information on bone
mineral density. When utilizing the FRAX algorithm select YES for secondary
osteoporosis for individuals with hypogonadism. ADT should be considered
“secondary osteoporosis” when using the FRAX algorithm. A previous major
osteoporotic fracture (hip fracture or spine fracture) is considered clinical
osteoporosis and warrants bone antiresorptive drug therapy independent of bone
mineral density.

• A baseline dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan should be obtained
before starting ADT in patients at increased risk for fracture based on FRAX
screening and being considered for antiresorptive therapy (see Table 1). For
patients at low risk of fracture based on the FRAX risk assessment, baseline DEXA
scan can be omitted. The exact FRAX fracture risk threshold has not been defined
in this population. One approach is to set the threshold at 10-year risk of major
osteoporotic fracture (calculated without DEXA) greater than that of a 65-year old
white woman with no additional risk factors (defined as 8.4% in the United States).

• Treatment for osteoporosis is advised according to guidelines for the general

population from the Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation.1 These guidelines
(see Table 1) include recommendations for: 1) calcium (1000–1200 mg daily from
food, with supplements if intake is insufficient); 2) vitamin D3 (serum levels of
30–50 ng/mL with supplements prescribed if needed); and 3) pharmacologic
treatment for men aged ≥50 years with low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and
-2.5, osteopenia) at the femoral neck or total hip by DEXA scan with a 10-year
probability of hip fracture ≥3% or a 10-year probability of a major osteoporosis-
related fracture ≥20% based on FRAX screening (see Table 2).

• Antiresorptive medications that increase bone mineral density

and reduce disease-related skeletal complications during ADT for
prostate cancer include denosumab (60 mg subcutaneously [SQ]
every 6 months), zoledronic acid (5 mg IV annually), and alendronate
(70 mg PO weekly) (see Table 2). Treatment with either denosumab,
zoledronic acid, or alendronate sodium is recommended when the
absolute fracture risk warrants drug therapy.
Choice of agent may depend on underlying comorbidities, whether

the patient has been treated with zoledronic acid previously,
logistics, and/or cost considerations.

Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid or alendronate) can cause
side effects of acute phase reaction, joint pain, hypocalcemia,
osteonecrosis of the jaw, nephrotoxicity with need for dose
modification for renal insufficiency, ocular toxicities, and atypical
femoral fractures with prolonged use (>3–5 years).

Denosumab can cause side effects of hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis

of the jaw, and atypical femoral fractures with prolonged use.
The risk factors for denosumab-associated hypocalcemia include
blastic bone metastases, renal impairment, vitamin D deficiency,
the lack of prophylactic supplementation of calcium and/or vitamin
D, preexisting hypoparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia, and gastric
bypass. Although renal monitoring is not required, denosumab
is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance <30
mL/min given risk of severe hypocalcemia. Calcium, creatinine,
and vitamin D levels should be checked prior to initiating therapy.
Periodic monitoring of serum calcium levels is recommended
with denosumab use. Stopping denosumab therapy can result in
rebound bone loss and fractures; therefore it is recommended
to administer at least one dose of a potent bisphosphonate
(zoledronic acid 4 or 5 mg) to prevent rebound bone loss and
presumably rebound fracture.2

PRINCIPLES OF BONE HEALTH IN PROSTATE CANCER

Treatment-Related Bone Loss Continued
The risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw is increased in patients who have tooth extractions, poor dental hygiene, or a dental appliance. To prevent

osteonecrosis of the jaw, it is recommended that all patients have a comprehensive dental evaluation prior to initiating an osteoclast inhibitor.3 If invasive
dental procedures are required, bone-targeted therapy should be withheld until the dentist indicates that the patient has healed completely from all dental
procedure(s). Stopping denosumab represents a dilemma is this context, and the clinician must carefully weigh the risk of rebound spine fractures
versus the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.

• Annual assessment of fracture risk using the FRAX risk assessment tool is recommended for all patients on ADT or those who remain hypogonadal after
completion of ADT (see Table 1).  Depending on the fracture risk and prior DEXA scan results, repeat DEXA scan in 1 to 2 years is recommended for those
patients on ADT. For individuals initiated on antiresorptive therapy, a follow-up DEXA scan after 1 year of treatment is recommended by the International
Society for Clinical Densitometry, although there is no consensus on the optimal approach to monitoring the effectiveness of bone treatment. Use of
biochemical markers of bone turnover to monitor response to therapy is not recommended. There are currently no guidelines on how often to monitor
vitamin D levels.

• For patients receiving antiresorptive therapy, there are currently no consensus guidelines on duration of treatment. Due to concerns of long-term risks
of antiresorptive therapy, a “drug holiday” at 3 to 5 years can be considered based on agent utilized, stability of bone mineral density, prior fracture
history, and future fracture risk. Bone mineral density should be monitored approximately every 1 to 2 years after suspending therapy, and therapy should
generally be resumed if bone mineral density declines significantly or if the patient develops a new fragility fracture.

Prevention of Symptomatic Skeletal-Related Events (SREs) in Patients with Bone-Metastatic CRPC

PRINCIPLES OF BONE HEALTH IN PROSTATE CANCER

• In patients with CRPC who have bone metastases, denosumab and zoledronic acid have been shown to prevent disease-related skeletal complications,

which include fracture, spinal cord compression, or the need for surgery or RT to bone.

• When compared to zoledronic acid, denosumab was shown to be superior in prevention of SREs in patients with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), albeit with
numerically higher hypocalcemia and osteonecrosis of the jaw risks. Initial studies investigated zoledronic acid and denosumab administered every 4
weeks. Subsequent studies demonstrated that every-12-week dosing of zoledronic acid compared to every-4-week dosing did not increase the risk of
skeletal events.4,5 Every-12-week dosing of zoledronic acid is recommended for symptomatic SRE reduction when indicated. Every-12-week dosing of
denosumab is under investigation and current data suggest non-inferior symptomatic skeletal events compared to every-4-week dosing.5 Utilization of
zoledronic acid and denosumab for symptomatic SRE reduction requires consideration of degree of benefit and risk associated with therapy to optimize
use, dose, and schedule. It is important to recognize that testing of zoledronic acid and denosumab in bone-metastatic CRPC was conducted during an
era when treatment options for mCRPC were largely limited to docetaxel chemotherapy. Subsequent studies investigating abiraterone, enzalutamide,
cabazitaxel, radium-223, and Lu-177–PSMA-617 have demonstrated improvement of SREs with treatment. While radium-223 did improve symptomatic
SREs in patients with bone mCRPC, the combination of radium-223 with abiraterone was associated with increased frequency of bone fractures,
particularly in individuals not receiving an antiresorptive agent.6

• A phase 3 clinical trial that assessed the role for zoledronic acid in patients with castration-sensitive disease beginning ADT for bone metastases was

negative.7 Therefore, use of osteoclast inhibitors for reduction of symptomatic SREs in metastatic castration-sensitive disease with bone metastases is
not recommended. However, usage of these agents to prevent bone loss and fragility fractures at appropriate doses and dosing intervals should be utilized
when clinically appropriate in this context (see Treatment-Related Bone Loss, PROS-B 1 of 4).

GERMLINE TESTING

PRINCIPLES OF GENETICS AND MOLECULAR/BIOMARKER ANALYSIS

For details regarding the nuances of genetic counseling and testing, see Principles of Cancer Risk Assessment and Counseling (EVAL-A) in
the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic and Prostate.

• Pre-test Considerations
The Panel recommends inquiring about family and personal history of cancer, and known germline variants at time of initial diagnosis.

Criteria for germline testing (see CRIT-6 in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic
and Prostate and HRS-3 in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal, Endometrial, and Gastric) should
be reviewed at time of initial diagnosis and, if relevant, at recurrence.

Germline testing is also recommended for patients with metastatic, regional (node positive), very-high-risk localized, or high-risk localized

prostate cancer.

Germline testing should be considered in appropriate individuals where it is likely to impact the prostate cancer treatment and clinical trial

options, management of risk of other cancers, and/or potential risk of cancer in family members.

•  Testing
If criteria are met, multigene testing is recommended (see GENE-1 in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment:

Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic and Prostate).

• Post-test Considerations
Post-test genetic counseling is strongly recommended if a germline mutation (pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant) is identified. Cascade

testing for relatives is critical to inform the risk for familial cancers in all relatives.

Post-test genetic counseling is recommended if positive family history but no pathogenic variant OR if only germline variants of uncertain
significance (VUS) are identified. This is to ensure accurate understanding of family implications and review indications for additional
testing and/or follow-up (including clinical trials of reclassification).

Resources are available to review the available data supporting pathogenic consequences of specific variants (eg, https://www.ncbi.nlm.

nih.gov/clinvar/; https://brcaexchange.org/about/app).

Individuals should be counseled to inform providers of any updates to family cancer history.

SOMATIC TUMOR TESTING

PRINCIPLES OF GENETICS AND MOLECULAR/BIOMARKER ANALYSIS

• Pre-test Considerations
At present, tumor molecular and biomarker analysis is recommended for patients with metastatic disease for treatment decision-making,

including understanding eligibility for biomarker-directed treatments, genetic counseling, and eligibility for clinical trials. Clinical trials may
include established and/or candidate molecular biomarkers for eligibility.

Tumor molecular profiles may change with subsequent treatments and re-evaluation may be considered at time of cancer progression for

treatment decision-making.

Patients should be informed that tumor molecular analysis by DNA sequencing has the potential to uncover germline findings.

Confirmatory germline testing may be recommended [see Post-test Considerations (below) and Tumor Testing:s Potential Implications for
Germline Testing in the Principles of Cancer Risk Assessment and Counseling (EVAL-A) in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-
Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic and Prostate].

• Testing
Somatic testing for alterations in DNA damage response:

 ◊ Multigene tumor testing for alterations in HRR genes, including but not limited to BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D,

CHEK2, and CDK12, is recommended in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. This testing can be considered in patients with regional
prostate cancer.
 – Loss of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be especially associated with response to PARP inhibitor therapy compared to other HRR gene

alterations.

 ◊ Tumor testing for MSI-H or dMMR is recommended in patients with mCRPC and may be considered in patients with regional or

castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer.

 ◊ TMB testing is recommended in patients with mCRPC.

• Tumor Specimen and Assay Considerations
The Panel strongly recommends a metastatic biopsy for histologic and molecular evaluation. This could include lymph node biopsy for

patients with N1 disease.
 ◊ When metastatic biopsy is unsafe or unfeasible, plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay is an option, preferably collected during

biochemical (PSA) and/or radiographic progression in order to maximize diagnostic yield. When diagnostic yield is low, the risk of false
negatives is higher, so ctDNA collection is not recommended when PSA is undetectable.

Caution is needed when interpreting ctDNA-only evaluation due to potential interference from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate

potential (CHIP), which can result in a false-positive biomarker signal.

DNA analysis for MSI and immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair (MMR) are different assays measuring different biological effects
caused by dMMR function. If MSI is used, testing using a next-generation sequencing assay validated for prostate cancer is preferred.

• Post-test Considerations
Post-test genetic counseling is recommended if pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant (mutation) identified in any gene that has clinical

implications if also identified in germline (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, HOXB13, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2).
Post-test genetic counseling to assess for the possibility of Lynch syndrome is recommended if MSI-H or dMMR is found.

PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND SHARED DECISION-MAKING

• Treatments for patients with localized prostate cancer have risks and side effects that must be considered in the context of the risk posed by

the disease.1-4

•  Baseline urinary, sexual, and bowel function are strongly associated with functional outcomes among patients undergoing treatment.1-4
•  Thus, it is important to measure baseline disease-specific function (urinary, sexual, and bowel function), preferably using a standardized

patient-reported outcomes instrument (eg, EPIC-265).

•  Shared decision-making in a multidisciplinary manner regarding initial management of localized prostate cancer should include an

explanation of the potential benefits and potential harms of each option. The provider should explain the likelihood of cure, recurrence,
disease progression, and disease-specific mortality with each management option, taking into account disease severity and competing
risks. In addition to the primary intended effects of treatment, the clinician should discuss the side effects of each treatment and predicted
impact on quality of life, including urinary, sexual, and bowel function. Patient preferences should be elicited and should be incorporated
into the disease management decision.6

PRINCIPLES OF IMAGING

Discussion

Goals of Imaging
• Imaging is performed for the detection and characterization of disease to select treatment or guide change in disease management.
• Imaging techniques can evaluate anatomic or functional parameters.
Anatomic imaging techniques include ultrasound, CT, and MRI.
Functional imaging techniques include radionuclide bone scan, PET/CT, and advanced MRI techniques, such as spectroscopy and

diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).

Efficacy of Imaging
• The utility of imaging for patients with early PSA persistence/recurrence after RP depends on risk group prior to operation, pathologic

Gleason grade and stage, PSA, and PSADT after recurrence. Low- and intermediate-risk groups with low serum PSAs postoperatively have a
very low risk of positive bone scans or CT scans.

• Frequency of imaging should be based on individual risk, age, PSADT, Gleason score, and overall health.
• Bone scans are rarely positive in asymptomatic patients with PSA <10 ng/mL. The relative risk for bone metastasis or death increases as
PSADT shortens. Bone imaging should be performed more frequently when PSADT is ≤8 months, where there appears to be an inflection
point.

Ultrasound
• Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to image small regions of the body.
Standard ultrasound imaging provides anatomic information.
Vascular flow can be assessed using Doppler ultrasound techniques.
• Endorectal ultrasound is used to guide transrectal biopsies of the prostate. Endorectal ultrasound can be considered for patients with

suspected recurrence after RP to guide prostate bed biopsy.

• Advanced ultrasound techniques for imaging of the prostate and for differentiation between prostate cancer and prostatitis are under

evaluation.

Bone Imaging
• The use of the term “bone scan” refers to the technetium-99m-MDP
bone scan in which technetium is taken up by bone that is turning
over and imaged with a gamma camera using planar imaging or 3D
imaging with single-photon emission CT (SPECT).
Sites of increased uptake imply accelerated bone turnover and may

indicate metastatic disease.

Osseous metastatic disease may be diagnosed based on the

overall pattern of activity, or in conjunction with anatomic imaging.

• Plain films, CT, MRI, or PET/CT or PET/MRI with F-18 piflufolastat

prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), Ga-68 PSMA-11, F-18
flotufolastat PSMA, F-18 sodium fluoride, or C-11 choline can be
considered for equivocal results on initial bone scan.

• Ga-68 PSMA-11, F-18 piflufolastat PSMA, or F-18 flotufolastat PSMA-

PET/CT or PET/MRI (full body imaging) can be considered as an
alternative to bone scan.

• Bone imaging is indicated in the initial evaluation of patients at high

risk for skeletal metastases.

• Bone imaging can be considered for the evaluation of the patient

post-prostatectomy when PSA does not fall to undetectable levels,
or when there is undetectable PSA after RP with a subsequent
detectable PSA that increases on ≥2 subsequent determinations.

• Bone imaging can be considered for the evaluation of patients

with an increasing PSA or positive DRE after RT if the patient is a
candidate for additional local therapy or systemic therapy.

• Bone scans are helpful to monitor metastatic prostate cancer to
determine the clinical benefit of systemic therapy. However, new
lesions seen on an initial post-treatment bone scan, compared to the
pretreatment baseline scan, may not indicate disease progression.
• New lesions in the setting of a falling PSA or soft tissue response
and in the absence of pain progression at that site may indicate
bone scan flare or an osteoblastic healing reaction. For this
reason, a confirmatory bone scan 8–12 weeks later is warranted
to determine true progression from flare reaction. Additional new
lesions favor progression. Stable scans make continuation of
treatment reasonable. Bone scan flare is common, particularly on
initiation of new hormonal therapy, and may be observed in nearly

half of patients treated with the newer agents, enzalutamide and
abiraterone. Similar flare phenomena may exist with other imaging
modalities, such as CT or PET/CT imaging.

• Bone scans and soft tissue imaging (CT or MRI) in patients with
metastatic or non-metastatic prostate cancer may be obtained
regularly during systemic therapy to assess clinical benefit.

• Bone scans should be performed for symptoms and as often as

every 6–12 months to monitor ADT. The need for soft tissue images
remains unclear. In CRPC, 8- to 12-week imaging intervals appear
reasonable.

• Plain Radiography
Plain radiography can be used to evaluate symptomatic regions in
the skeleton. However, plain films will not detect a bone lesion until
nearly 50% of the mineral content of the bone is lost or gained.

CT or MRI may be more useful to assess fracture risk as

these modalities permit more accurate assessment of cortical
involvement than plain films where osteoblastic lesions may
obscure cortical involvement.

Soft Tissue Imaging
• Soft tissue imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest can include:
Chest CT and abdomen/pelvis CT or abdomen/pelvis MRI or
PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI for bone and soft tissue (full

body) imaging.

• Computed Tomography
CT provides a high level of anatomic detail, and may detect gross
extracapsular disease, nodal metastatic disease, and/or visceral
metastatic disease.

CT is generally not sufficient to evaluate the prostate gland.
CT may be performed with IV contrast, and CT technique should be
optimized to maximize diagnostic utility while minimizing radiation
dose.

CT can be used for examination of the pelvis and/or abdomen for

initial evaluation (PROS-2) and as part of workup for recurrence or
progression (see PROS-10 through PROS-16).

• Magnetic Resonance Imaging
The strengths of MRI include high soft tissue contrast and

characterization, multiparametric image acquisition, multiplanar
imaging capability, and the use of specific MRI sequences to
assess function.
 ◊ MRI can be performed with and without the administration of IV

contrast material.

 ◊ Resolution of MRI images in the pelvis can be augmented using

a phased array/endorectal coil.

Standard MRI techniques can be used for examination of the

pelvis and/or abdomen for initial evaluation (PROS-1) and as part
of workup for recurrence or progression (see PROS-10 through
PROS-16).

MRI may be considered in patients after RP when PSA does not

fall to undetectable levels or when an undetectable PSA becomes
detectable and increases on ≥2 subsequent determinations, or
after RT for increasing PSA or positive DRE if the patient is a
candidate for additional local therapy. MRI-ultrasound fusion
biopsy may improve the detection of higher grade (Grade Group
≥2) cancers.

Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) can be used in the staging and

characterization of prostate cancer. mpMRI images are defined as
images acquired with at least one more sequence in addition to the
anatomical T2-weighted images, such as DWI or dynamic contrast-
enhanced (DCE) images. mpMRI may be used to better risk stratify
patients who are considering active surveillance. Additionally,
mpMRI may detect large and poorly differentiated prostate cancer
(Grade Group ≥2) and detect extracapsular extension (T staging)
and is preferred over CT for abdomen/pelvis staging. mpMRI has
been shown to be equivalent to CT scan for pelvic lymph node
evaluation.

Full Body Imaging
• Positron Emission Tomography
PSMA-PET refers to a growing body of radiopharmaceuticals that
target PSMA on the surface of prostate cells. There are multiple
PSMA radiopharmaceuticals at various stages of investigation.

At this time, the NCCN Guidelines only recommend the currently
FDA-approved PSMA agents: F-18 piflufolastat PSMA (also known
as F-18 DCFPyL), F-18 flotufolastat PSMA (also known as rh-
PSMA-7.3), and Ga-68 PSMA-11. Throughout these Guidelines,
“PSMA-PET” refers to any of these FDA-approved PSMA ligands.
See Table 2 in the Discussion section for more details.
F-18 flotufolastat PSMA is a PET imaging agent that is part
of a class of tracers referred to as radiohybrid (rh) ligands.
These tracers have two binding sites for radionuclides for both
imaging and treatment, but the significance of this remains to be
determined.

PSMA-PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered as an alternative
to CT, MRI, and bone scans for initial staging, the detection of
biochemically recurrent disease, and as workup for progression.
Synthesis of Ga-68 PSMA-11 requires that the PSMA-11 ligand is

labeled with Ga-68 from a generator or cyclotron. Two commercial
kits to perform this in nuclear pharmacies have been approved by
the FDA.

C-11 choline PET/CT or PET/MRI may be used to detect small-

volume recurrent disease in soft tissues and in bone.

Studies suggest that PSMA-PET imaging has a higher sensitivity
than C-11 choline PET imaging, especially at very low PSA levels.
Because of the increased sensitivity and specificity of PSMA-PET

tracers for detecting micrometastatic disease compared to CT, MRI,
and bone scan at both initial staging and BCR, PSMA-PET/CT or
PSMA-PET/MRI can serve as a more effective frontline imaging tool
for these patients.

Histologic or radiographic confirmation of involvement detected

by PET imaging is recommended whenever feasible due to
the presence of false positives. Although false positives exist,
literature suggests that these are outweighed by the increase in
true positives detected by PET relative to CT, MRI, and bone scans.
To reduce the false-positive rate, physicians should consider the
intensity of PSMA-PET uptake and correlative CT findings in the
interpretation of scans. Several reporting systems have been
proposed but will not have been validated or widely used.

PSMA imaging should be done before initiation of ADT because

ADT may affect detection sensitivity.

High variability among PET/CT or PET/MRI equipment, protocols,

interpretation, and institutions provides challenges for application
and interpretation of the utility of PET/CT or PET/MRI.

Table 2 in the Discussion section provides a summary of the main
imaging tracers utilized for study in prostate cancer both before
definitive therapy and at recurrence.

PET/CT or PET/MRI results may change treatment but may not

change oncologic outcome.

When patients with the worst prognosis move from one risk

group to the higher risk group, the average outcome of both risk
groups will improve even if treatment has no impact on disease.
This phenomenon is known as the Will Rogers effect, in which
the improved outcomes of both groups could be falsely attributed
to improvement in treatment, but would be due only to improved
risk group assignment. As an example, F-18 sodium fluoride PET/
CT may categorize some patients as M1b who would have been
categorized previously as M0 using a bone scan (stage migration).
Absent any change in the effectiveness of therapy, the overall
survival (OS) of both M1b and M0 groups would improve. The
definition of M0 and M1 disease for randomized clinical trials
that added docetaxel or abiraterone to ADT was based on CT and
radionuclide bone scans. Results suggest that OS of M1 disease
is improved, whereas progression-free but not OS of M0 disease
is improved. Therefore, a subset of patients now diagnosed with
M1 disease using F-18 sodium fluoride PET/CT might not benefit
from the more intensive therapy used in these trials and could
achieve equivalent OS from less intensive therapy aimed at M0
disease. Carefully designed clinical trials using proper staging
will be necessary to prove therapeutic benefit, rather than making
assumptions compromised by stage migration.

Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT should not be used routinely
for staging prostate cancer since data are limited in this setting.
F-18 FDG-PET has been shown to be prognostic in patients with

progressive CRPC.1,2

The increasing use of PSMA-PET has identified the potential for

considerable biological diversity among disease foci within a given
individual with prostate cancer, especially mCRPC, and that this
heterogeneity can be detected with a combination of PSMA-PET
and FDG-PET. Initial data suggest that metastases with PSMA-
negative/FDG-positive mismatches may exist in patients with
mCRPC undergoing Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy and that patients
with these mismatches may have worse outcomes. Currently, no
robust clinical trial data exist to support the incorporation of FDG-
PET into routine clinical use alongside PSMA-PET. To overcome
the limitations of PSMA-PET in PSMA-negative metastatic disease,
the Panel currently recommends the use of contrast-enhanced
CT or MRI in these patients, as the non-contrast CT component of
PSMA-PET/CT is insufficient to detect visceral metastatic disease.

Imaging as Workup for Progression
• Workup for progression should include bone and soft tissue

evaluation.
See Bone Imaging (PROS-E [2 of 4]).
See Soft Tissue Imaging (PROS-E [2 of 4]).
• Imaging for patients with progressive mCRPC should include

chest CT, bone imaging, and abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast or
abdomen/pelvis MRI with and without contrast. There is a lack of
evidence to support the use of PET imaging in this setting.

PRINCIPLES OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE AND OBSERVATION

• The NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel and the NCCN Prostate Cancer Early Detection Panel (NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer

Early Detection) remain concerned about overdiagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Panel recommends that
patients and their physicians carefully consider active surveillance based on the patient’s prostate cancer risk profile and estimated life
expectancy. In settings where the patient’s age and comorbidities suggest a shorter life expectancy, observation may be more appropriate.
Shared decision-making, after appropriate counseling on the risks and benefits of the various options, is critical.

ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE1
• Active surveillance involves actively monitoring the course of disease with the expectation to intervene with curative intent if the cancer

progresses.

• Life Expectancy:
Life expectancy is a key determinant for the choice between observation, active surveillance, and definitive treatment.
Consider incorporating a validated metric of comorbidity such as the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 Index (ACE-27)2 to differentiate

between recommendations for observation versus active surveillance. Prior studies did not incorporate a validated metric of comorbidity
to estimate life expectancy (Table 1 on PROS-F 4 of 5), which is a potential limitation when interpreting the data for a patient who is in
excellent health.

Life expectancy can be challenging to estimate for individual patients (Principles of Life Expectancy Estimation, PROS-A).

• Candidacy for Active Surveillance:
Active surveillance is preferred for patients with very-low-risk prostate cancer (Risk Group Criteria [PROS-2]) and a life expectancy ≥10

years. (Observation is preferred for patients with a life expectancy <10 years and very-low-risk disease.)

Active surveillance is preferred for most patients with low-risk prostate cancer (Risk Group Criteria [PROS-2]) and a life expectancy ≥10

years. The Panel recognizes that there is heterogeneity across this risk group, and that some factors may be associated with an increased
probability of near-term grade reclassification including high PSA density, a high number of positive cores (eg, ≥3), and high genomic risk
(from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis).3 For some of these patients, upfront treatment with RP or prostate RT may be preferred
based on shared decision-making.

Patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer (Risk Group Criteria [PROS-2]) and a life expectancy >10 years may also consider
active surveillance. Particular consideration for active surveillance may be appropriate for those patients with a low percentage of Gleason
pattern 4 cancer, low tumor volume, low PSA density, and/or low genomic risk (from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis). Active
surveillance is not recommended for patients with favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer and unfavorable histology (eg, expansile/
large cribriform histology, intraductal carcinoma). See Discussion.

Please see Table 1 (PROS-F 4 of 5) for a summary of major active surveillance cohorts, including their inclusion criteria.

Discussion

PRINCIPLES OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE AND OBSERVATION

• Confirmatory Testing to Establish Appropriateness of Active Surveillance:
Goals of confirmatory testing are to help facilitate early identification of those patients who may be at a higher risk of future grade

reclassification or cancer progression.

Since an initial prostate biopsy may underestimate tumor grade or volume, confirmatory testing is strongly recommended within the first 6

to 12 months of diagnosis for patients who are considering active surveillance.

Options for confirmatory testing include prostate biopsy, mpMRI with calculation of PSA density (and repeat biopsy as indicated), and/or

molecular tumor analysis. See Principles of Risk Stratification and Biomarkers (PROS-H). Other forms of imaging are discouraged.

Early confirmatory testing may not be necessary in patients who have had an mpMRI prior to diagnostic biopsy.
All patients should undergo a confirmatory prostate biopsy within 1–2 years of their diagnostic biopsy.

• Active Surveillance Program:
Patients who choose active surveillance should have regular follow-up, and key principles include:

 ◊ PSA no more often than every 6 months unless clinically indicated.
 ◊ DRE no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated.
 ◊ Repeat prostate biopsy no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated. While the intensity of surveillance may be

tailored based on patient and tumor factors (eg, grade, tumor volume), most patients should have prostate biopsies every 2 to 5 years as
part of their monitoring.

 ◊ Consider repeat mpMRI no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated.
 ◊ In patients with a suspicious lesion on mpMRI, MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy improves the detection of higher grade (Grade Group ≥2)

cancers.

 ◊ Patients should be transitioned to observation when life expectancy is <10 years.
 ◊ Repeat molecular tumor analysis is discouraged.
 ◊ The intensity of surveillance may be tailored based on patient life expectancy and risk of reclassification.
◊ A metastatic staging evaluation (PSMA PET, bone scan, CT scan, or whole body MRI) should not be performed.

• Considerations for Treatment of Patients on Active Surveillance:
Grade reclassification on repeat biopsy is the most common factor influencing a change from active surveillance to treatment.
Other factors affecting decisions to actively treat include: increase in tumor volume, a rise in PSA density, and patient anxiety.
Considerations for a change in disease management strategy should be made in the context of the patient’s life expectancy.

• Advantages of Active Surveillance:
Between 50% and 68% of those eligible for active surveillance may safely avoid treatment for at least 10 years.4-6
Patients will avoid possible side effects of definitive therapy that may be unnecessary while on active surveillance.
Quality of life/normal activities will be less affected while on active surveillance.
Risk of unnecessary treatment of small, indolent cancers will be reduced.

PRINCIPLES OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE AND OBSERVATION

• Limitations of Active Surveillance:
Between 32% and 50% of patients will undergo treatment by 10 years,4-6 although treatment delays do not seem to impact cure rate.
Although the risk is very low (<0.5% in most series), it is possible for cancer to progress to a regional or metastatic stage.4-6

OBSERVATION
• Observation involves monitoring with a history and physical examination no more often than every 12 months (without surveillance

biopsies) until symptoms develop or are thought to be imminent.

• Observation is recommended for:
Asymptomatic patients in very-low-, low-, and intermediate-risk groups with a life expectancy ≤5 years.
Asymptomatic patients with very-low- and low-risk prostate cancer with a life expectancy 5–10 years.
• Observation is preferred for:
Asymptomatic patients with favorable and unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy between 5–10 years.
• Observation may be considered for:
Asymptomatic patients with high-risk, very-high-risk, regional, and metastatic prostate cancer and a life expectancy ≤5 years.
• Life expectancy can be challenging to estimate for individual patients (Principles of Life Expectancy Estimation, PROS-A). Consider

incorporating a validated metric of comorbidity (see Life Expectancy, PROS-F 1 of 5).

• If patients under observation become symptomatic, an assessment of disease burden can be performed, and treatment or palliation can be

considered (PROS-13).

• Advantages of Observation:
Patients will avoid possible side effects of unnecessary confirmatory testing and definitive therapy.

• Limitations of Observation:
There may be a risk of local or systemic symptoms (eg, urinary retention, pathologic fracture), without prior symptoms or concerning PSA

levels.

PRINCIPLES OF ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY

Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with RTa:

• Clinically localized (N0, M0) disease
• Regional (N1, M0) disease
• Positive lymph nodes (pN1 disease) and/or adverse features post-RP
• M0 RP PSA persistence/recurrence (without maximal pelvic therapy)

RT with one of the following ADT options:
• Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist monotherapy
Goserelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin
• LHRH agonist (as above) plus first-generation antiandrogen
Nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide
• LHRH antagonist
Degarelix or relugolix
• LHRH agonist or antagonist plus abirateroneb (2 years; only for very-high-risk localized disease or positive lymph nodes)
Notes:
• For unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with RT, short-term ADT (ST-ADT) (4–6 months) is recommended. Concurrent/

adjuvant ADT is preferred over neoadjuvant ADT in this setting.

• For high-risk and very-high-risk prostate cancer treated with EBRT alone, long-term ADT (LT-ADT) (18–36 months) is recommended.
• For high-risk and very-high-risk prostate cancer treated with combination EBRT + brachytherapy, a shortened duration of ADT (12 months)

can be considered.

• For additional details on the use of RT with ADT by risk group, see PROS-I.
• M0 PSA persistence/recurrence:
The timing of secondary treatment for patients whose only evidence of cancer after definitive treatment is an increasing PSA is influenced

by PSA velocity, patient anxiety, the short- and long-term side effects of ADT, and the underlying comorbidities of the patient.

Earlier treatment may be better than delayed treatment, although the definitions of early and late (what level of PSA) are controversial.

Since the benefit of early treatment is not clear, treatment should be individualized until definitive studies are done. Patients with a shorter
PSADT (or a rapid PSA velocity) and an otherwise long life expectancy should be encouraged to consider treatment earlier.

Patients with prolonged PSADTs (>12 months) and who are older are candidates for observation or monitoring.
Patients who choose ADT monotherapy in the secondary treatment setting should consider intermittent ADT.

a Specific recommendations, Categories of Evidence and Consensus, and Categories of Preference vary based on patient and disease characteristics (see PROS-6
through PROS-16). This chart delineates the forms of ADT that can be used and provide some additional details.
b The fine-particle formulation of abiraterone can be used instead of the standard form (category 2B; other recommended regimen). Abiraterone should be given with
concurrent steroid: prednisone 5 mg PO once daily (in the CSPC setting without docetaxel) or twice daily (in the CSPC setting with docetaxel and in the CRPC setting)
with the standard formulation or methylprednisolone 4 mg PO twice daily with the fine-particle formulation. The standard formulation of abiraterone can be given at 250
mg/day following a low-fat breakfast in patients who will not take or cannot afford the standard dose of 1000 mg/day after an overnight fast.

mg/day following a low-fat breakfast in patients who will not take or cannot afford the standard dose of 1000 mg/day after an overnight fast.
e ADT is strongly recommended in combination therapy for metastatic castration-sensitive disease. The use of ADT monotherapy in metastatic castration-sensitive
disease is discouraged unless there are clear contraindications to combination therapy. If ADT monotherapy is given, intermittent ADT can be considered to reduce
toxicity. Close monitoring of PSA and testosterone levels and possibly imaging is required when using intermittent ADT, especially during off-treatment periods, and
patients may need to switch to continuous ADT upon signs of disease progression.
f A first-generation antiandrogen must be given with LHRH agonist for ≥7 days to prevent testosterone flare if metastases are present in weightbearing bone or if there is
a large prostate mass.

PRINCIPLES OF ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY

Secondary Hormone Therapy for Patients with M0 or M1 CRPCa:
Castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dL) should be maintained while additional therapies are applied:
• Orchiectomy, LHRH agonist, or LHRH antagonist with specific therapies noted on PROS-14 [M0 CRPC], PROS-15 [NEPC], and PROS-16 [M1 CRPC]
• Orchiectomy, LHRH agonist, or LHRH antagonist with other secondary hormone options:
First-generation anti-androgen (nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide)
Corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, prednisone, or dexamethasone)
Antiandrogen withdrawal
Ketoconazole plus hydrocortisone
Abirateroneb or enzalutamide following progression on other novel hormone therapies (M1 only)
Abirateroneb plus 0.5 mg/day dexamethasone following progression on either formulation of abiraterone (M1 only)
Notes:

Optimal ADT:

PRINCIPLES OF ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY

• Medical castration (ie, LHRH agonist or antagonist) and surgical castration (ie, bilateral orchiectomy) are equally effective.
• Patients who do not achieve adequate suppression of serum testosterone (<50 ng/dL) with medical or surgical castration can be considered
for additional hormonal manipulations (with antiandrogens, LHRH antagonists, or steroids), although the clinical benefit remains uncertain.
Consider monitoring testosterone levels 12 weeks after first dose of LHRH therapy, then upon increase in PSA. The optimal level of serum
testosterone to affect “castration” has yet to be determined.

• Data are limited on long-term adherence to oral relugolix and the potential effects on optimal ADT. Ongoing monitoring for sustained

suppression of testosterone (<50 ng/dL) can be considered, and relugolix may not be a preferred agent if adherence to the prescribed
regimen is uncertain.

Monitor/Surveillance:

• ADT has a variety of adverse effects, including hot flashes, loss of libido,  erectile dysfunction, shrinkage of penis and testicles, loss
of muscle mass and strength, fatigue, anemia, breast enlargement and tenderness/soreness, depression and mood swings, hair loss,
osteoporosis, greater incidence of clinical fractures, obesity, insulin resistance, alterations in lipids, and greater risk for diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. The intensity and spectrum of these side effects vary greatly, and many are reversible or can be avoided or
mitigated. See NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship. Patients and their medical providers should be advised about these risks prior to
treatment.

General Principles:

PRINCIPLES OF RISK STRATIFICATION AND BIOMARKERS

• Currently, the primary method for personalization of treatment from localized to advanced prostate cancer is based on prognostic risk

stratification, rather than the use predictive biomarkers.

• NCCN uses multiple categories and subgroupings to capture prognostic risk to personalize treatment recommendations.
• The purpose of the NCCN categories and subgroupings are to provide a method for risk stratification to allow standardized treatment

recommendations to be provided.
It is acknowledged that there are methods of risk stratification with superior prognostic performance to NCCN risk groups. However, they
have not been routinely reported in clinical trials. This limits the ability to provide evidence-based guideline treatment recommendations
using these methods. Thus, the NCCN Guidelines continues to use NCCN categories and subgroups of risk as a framework.

Clinical trials have established the benefit of various treatments in prostate cancer and have commonly enrolled patients across a

spectrum of risk. Subgroup analyses, absolute benefit estimates, and expert opinion are used to provide treatment recommendations for
each NCCN risk group or disease state.

There is intrinsic heterogeneity in prognosis within a given NCCN category and subgroup. Thus, treatment recommendations for adjacent

subgroups or categories of risk may be appropriate when using additional risk stratification methods.

The Panel acknowledges the ability to personalize treatment decisions through additional tools and have created this section to assist.
• Tools that are prognostic or predictive in one disease state may not be in other disease states, or they may have other forms of clinical utility

beyond prognostication and prediction of treatment benefit.
For example, germline homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) mutations do not have an established prognostic or predictive role
in localized prostate cancer, but specific HRD mutations have been demonstrated to have a prognostic and predictive role in advanced
disease. Additionally, the utility of germline testing extends to inform screening recommendations for other cancers and cascade germline
testing for family members.

• Imaging is also a biomarker (ie, MRI, PSMA-PET/CT) and can aid in risk stratification. See Principles of Imaging (PROS-E).

Biomarker Categories:

PRINCIPLES OF RISK STRATIFICATION AND BIOMARKERS

• Biomarkers and risk stratification methods are tools that may assist in personalization of treatment. For clarity these tools are separated by

type and category:

Type:

 ◊ Standard Tools: These include clinical and/or pathologic variables routinely collected to assign a patient to an NCCN category and/or

subgroup. Examples include TNM stage, Grade Group, PSA, and metastatic volume of disease.

 ◊ Clinical and Pathologic Tools: These include clinical and/or pathologic tools that are generally derived from standard tools. Examples

include multivariable models or nomograms, histologic variants, and PSA kinetics.

 ◊ Advanced Tools: These involve an additional test above what is collected to assign an NCCN category or subgroup. These may include,

but are not limited to, germline or somatic tests, gene expression tests, digital histopathology-based tests, imaging, and circulating
markers.

Category:

 ◊ Prognostic: Discriminates the risk of developing an oncologic endpoint (eg, distant metastasis). The relative benefit of a treatment (ie, the
treatment effect or hazard ratio) is generally similar across a prognostic spectrum, although the absolute benefit of an intervention may
vary by risk (ie, number needed to treat [NNT]).
 – Ideally, prognostic biomarkers independently discriminate and are associated with a clinically meaningful endpoint above and beyond

standard tools relevant to that disease setting that ultimately helps guide a therapeutic decision.

 ◊ Predictive: Discriminates a difference in the relative benefit of a specific treatment for an oncologic endpoint.

 – Ideally, predictive biomarkers have been demonstrated to measure a biomarker-treatment interaction that ultimately helps guide a

therapeutic decision in the context of a randomized trial, specifically randomizing the treatment of interest.

Clinical and Pathologic Tools:

PRINCIPLES OF RISK STRATIFICATION AND BIOMARKERS

• An extensive number of prognostic clinical or pathologic tools have been reported based on highly variable evidence quality (retrospective

or registry study vs. randomized trial), validation rigor, strength of endpoint (adverse pathology or biochemical recurrence vs. distant
metastasis), and univariable versus multivariable association with an outcome. Thus, while some of these tools may have value, these
limitations hinder the ability to accurately provide guidance to specific treatment recommendations with confidence.

• A comprehensive list of these tools is outside the scope of this guideline.
Examples of such prognostic tools include multivariable models and nomograms (ie, CAPRA,1 STAR-CAP,2 MSKCC nomograms3),

histopathology (ie, cribriform, intraductal carcinoma, percent Gleason pattern 4, total mm of cancer), and clinical variables (ie, PSA density,
PSA velocity, PSA level, PSADT).

Advanced Tools:

• There are advanced tools that have demonstrated superior prognostic performance beyond standard tools and/or serve as a predictive

biomarker that identifies patients who will differentially benefit from a specific treatment.

• These tools are an additional test that must be ordered, and thus are only recommended to be used when they have the potential ability to

change management and should not be ordered reflexively.

• These tools are not recommended for patients with very-low-risk prostate cancer.
• There are an extensive number of these tools created with substantial variability in quality of reporting and model design, endpoint selection,

Evidence: NRG/RTOG 0126 phase III randomized trial was profiled post-hoc with a prespecified analysis
plan.5 The study demonstrated the independent prognostic effect of GC on biochemical failure, secondary
therapy, DM, PCSM, MFS, and OS. Patients receiving RT alone with low GC scores had 10-year DM rates of
4%, compared with 16% for GC high risk.

Evidence synthesis: RT alone may be considered for patients with a low GC score and NCCN intermedi-
ate-risk disease. The addition of ST-ADT should be considered for patients with a high GC score given their
increased risk of DM and significant benefit of ST-ADT on DM, irrespective of RT dose or brachytherapy
boost.

Evidence: A meta-analysis of three phase III randomized trials (NRG/RTOG 9202, 9413, and 9902) were
profiled post-hoc with a prespecified analysis plan.6 The study demonstrated the independent prognostic
effect of GC on biochemical failure, DM, MFS, PCSM, and OS. Patients with low GC scores had 10-year DM
rates of 6%, compared with 26% for GC high risk. The absolute benefit of LT-ADT over ST-ADT was 11% for
patients with high GC scores (NNT of 9), and 3% for patients with low GC scores (NNT of 33).

Evidence synthesis: RT + LT-ADT should be recommended for most patients with NCCN high-risk disease
regardless of the GC score outside of a clinical trial, irrespective of RT dose or brachytherapy boost.
However, patients with a GC low-risk score should be counseled that the absolute benefit of LT-ADT over ST-
ADT is smaller than for patients with GC high-risk scores and when accounting for patient age, comorbidities,
and patient preferences, it may be reasonable with shared decision-making to use a duration shorter than
LT-ADT.

Evidence: Two phase III randomized trials post-RP were profiled post-hoc with prespecified analysis plans.
NRG/RTOG 9601 demonstrated the independent prognostic effect of GC on DM, PCSM, and OS, and found
that for patients with lower entry PSAs (<0.7 ng/mL), the 12-year DM rate benefit from hormone therapy for
patients with GC lower risk vs. GC higher risk was 0.4% vs. 11.2%.12 The SAKK 09/10 phase III trial tested
post-RP lower vs. higher dose RT alone. The study demonstrated the independent prognostic effect of GC
on biochemical progression, clinical progression, secondary hormone therapy, DM, and MFS.13

Evidence synthesis: For patients with node-negative disease post-RP planned for early secondary RT (PSA
≤0.5 ng/mL) with GC low or intermediate risk, use of RT alone should be considered. For patients planned for
early secondary RT with a GC high-risk tumor, use of secondary RT with ADT is recommended. At this time,
it is unclear how best to use GC for patients receiving late post-RP secondary RT (PSA >0.5 ng/mL). Optimal
ADT duration (ie, 6 vs. 24 months) based on GC score is unknown at this time.

LT-ADT = long-term ADT; MFS = metastasis-free survival; NNT = number needed to treat; PCSS = prostate cancer-specific survival; ST-ADT = short-term ADT

c SAKK 09/10 combined GC low and intermediate risk due to relatively similar prognosis. NRG/RTOG 9601 dichotomized patients by GC low versus intermediate and
high risk. However, due to the age of the tissue from NRG/RTOG 9601 (>20 years old) there is a known shifting of GC scores, and a more contemporary distribution of
score distribution would approximate closer to combining GC low and intermediate risk together.

synthesis

Evidence: A predictive biomarker for benefit of ST-ADT to RT was trained in four phase III
randomized trials and validated in NRG/RTOG 9408, a randomized trial of RT +/- 4 months of ST-
ADT.9 On validation, there was a significant biomarker-treatment interaction for DM (p-interaction
0.01). In patients with biomarker-positive disease, ST-ADT significantly reduced the risk of DM
compared to RT alone (sHR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19–0.63; P < .001). There were no significant
differences between treatment arms in the biomarker-negative subgroup (sHR = 0.92; 95% CI,
0.59–1.43; P = .71).

Evidence synthesis: Patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer planning to receive RT, those
with biomarker-positive disease, and especially those with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease,
should be recommended for the addition of ST-ADT regardless of RT dose or type, notwithstanding
contraindications to ADT. Those with biomarker (-) tumors, especially tumors with more favorable
prognostic risk, may consider the use of RT alone.

Evidence: Published results from seven phase III randomized trials (NRG/RTOG 9202, 9408, 9413,
9902, 9910, 0126, and 0521) with post-hoc derivation of MMAI scores have been reported.8,10,11
The MMAI model was superior for discrimination of DM and PCSM than standard clinical and
pathologic variables and models (5-year DM AUC was 0.83 vs. 0.72 for MMAI vs. NCCN,
respectively (P < .001)). For patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with RT + ADT, MMAI was
able to risk stratify patients with a 10-year DM risk of 8% for MMAI quartiles Q1–2 versus 26% for
MMAI Q3–4.21

Evidence synthesis: Specific MMAI cut points have not been published to date to precisely guide
specific treatment decisions. Rather, the test may be used to provide more accurate risk stratification
to enable improved shared decision-making.

Note: Although the MMAI score incorporates clinical and pathologic variables, it is important to not
confuse NCCN risk groups (low, intermediate, and high) with MMAI score groups (low, intermediate,
and high).

AUC = area under the curve; BCR = biochemical recurrence; DM = distant metastases; PCSM = prostate cancer-specific mortality; OS = overall survival;
sHR = subdistribution hazard ratio; ST-ADT = short term androgen deprivation therapy

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY

Definitive Radiation Therapy General Principles
• Highly conformal RT techniques should be used for the treatment of primary prostate cancer. Selection of treatment approach should balance trade-offs in

biochemical disease control, toxicity, logistical burden for the patient, and patient preferences.

• External Beam RT (EBRT):
Photon and proton RT are both forms of EBRT that appear to have generally comparable outcomes (toxicity, quality of life, and tumor control)

(Discussion).

The accuracy of EBRT should be verified by daily prostate localization to address interfraction setup uncertainty, with any of the following: techniques
of image-guided RT (IGRT) using CT, MRI, ultrasound, implanted fiducials, or electromagnetic targeting/tracking. Endorectal balloons may be used to
improve prostate immobilization. Advanced image guidance with real-time intrafraction tracking may allow further precision for margin reduction and
reduction in toxicity but requires quality validation.

Biocompatible and biodegradable perirectal spacer materials may be implanted between the prostate and rectum in patients undergoing external

radiotherapy with organ-confined prostate cancer in order to displace the rectum from high radiation dose regions for the purpose of toxicity reduction.
Patients with grossly apparent posterior extraprostatic extension should not undergo perirectal spacer implantation. Marginal or suspected early
extension is not a clear contraindication.

Various fractionation and dose regimens can be considered depending on the clinical scenario (Table 1 on PROS-I 4 of 8). Whole gland dose escalation

improves biochemical control while modestly increasing toxicity. Alternately, targeted dose escalation of imaging-defined (eg, MRI) intraprostatic
dominant disease, using a simultaneous integrated micro-boost, improves biochemical disease control, without added toxicity when using an isotoxic
approach that prioritizes normal organ constraints over boost target coverage.1

Stereotactic body RT (SBRT; also known as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, SABR) refers to a delivery of ultra-hypofractionated RT with high

precision treatment setup and image guidance techniques. SBRT is acceptable for treatment of primary prostate cancer across all risk groups and for
locoregional and/or distant metastases in practices with appropriate technology and expertise. Advanced imaging guidance with intrafraction tracking
when using intensified doses and/or especially tight treatment margins should be considered when available and validated, based on data showing
acute toxicity reduction. For primary site and/or regional nodal treatment with SBRT, simultaneous integrated boost for dosing of prostate, intraprostatic,
seminal vesicle, and/or regional nodal targets to differing doses may be used. In select patients, SBRT to the prostate may also be used as a boost in
combination with fractionated EBRT. Based upon data for improved durability of disease control and pain reduction compared to historical palliative
regimens, SBRT is recommended for metastasis-directed therapy in the following circumstances:
 ◊ In a patient with limited metastatic disease (eg, oligometastatic) when ablation is the goal.
 ◊ In a patient with limited progression (eg, oligoprogression) or limited residual disease on otherwise effective systemic therapy (eg, consolidation)

where progression-free survival (PFS) is the goal.

 ◊ In a symptomatic patient where the lesion occurs in or immediately adjacent to a previously irradiated treatment field.
 ◊ At physician discretion for more durable control of pain than achieved with typical palliative regimens used in some randomized trial data, which
should be considered particularly in prostate cancer where natural history of advanced disease can be very long. Regardless of SBRT or other
planning methods, hypofractionated palliative regimens are favored given long-established data for equivalent or superior pain control with
minimization of logistical burden to patients.2,3

• Biologically effective dose (BED) modeling with the linear-quadratic equation may not be accurate for ultra-hypofractionated (eg, SBRT) radiation.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY

• Brachytherapy:
Interstitial implantation of prostate +/- proximal seminal vesicles with temporary (high dose-rate, HDR) or permanent (low dose-rate, LDR) radioactive

sources for monotherapy or as boost when added to EBRT should be performed in practices with adequate training, experience, and quality assurance
measures.

Patient selection should consider aspects of gland size, baseline urinary symptoms, and prior procedures (ie, transurethral resection of prostate) that may

increase risk of adverse effects. Neoadjuvant ADT to shrink a gland to allow treatment should balance its additional toxicity with this benefit.

Post-implant dosimetry must be performed for LDR implants to verify dosimetry.
Brachytherapy boost, when added to EBRT and ADT, improves biochemical control. To address historical trial data concerns for increased toxicity
incidence, careful patient selection and contemporary planning associated with lesser toxicity, such as use of recognized organ at risk (OAR) dose
constraints, use of high-quality ultrasound and other imaging, and prescription of dose as close as possible to the target without excessive margins
should be implemented. Moreover, given trial data showing similar cancer control with lower toxicity with brachytherapy alone in unselected cohorts
with intermediate-risk prostate cancer, the use of combination EBRT with brachytherapy boost is best reserved for higher risk disease and unfavorable
intermediate-risk disease with several risk factors.4

Definitive Radiation Therapy by Risk Group (also see Table 1 on PROS-I [4 of 8] and PROS-I [5 of 8])
• Low riska,b
Patients with NCCN low-risk prostate cancer are encouraged to pursue active surveillance.
Those electing treatment with RT may receive prostate-only EBRT or brachytherapy but should not be treated with combination brachytherapy boost with

EBRT. ADT or antiandrogen therapy should NOT be used.

• Favorable intermediate riska,b
RT options include either EBRT or brachytherapy. Combination brachytherapy boost with EBRT should not be routinely used. ADT or antiandrogen therapy

is not used routinely but can be considered if additional risk assessments suggest aggressive tumor behavior.

• Unfavorable intermediate riska,b
RT options include EBRT, brachytherapy boost combined with EBRT, or brachytherapy alone. ADT should be used unless additional risk assessments
suggest less aggressive tumor behavior or if medically contraindicated. Whether the duration of ADT can be reduced when combined with EBRT and
brachytherapy remains unclear.

• High and very high riska,b
RT options include EBRT or brachytherapy boost combined with EBRT. Brachytherapy alone should not be routinely used. ADT (level 1 data for long-

term ADT; see PROS-7) is required for patients with life expectancy >5 years or who are symptomatic unless medically contraindicated. Use of intensified
androgen receptor pathway inhibition strategies should be considered in select patients (see PROS-7 and PROS-G 1 of 6). Addition of abiraterone should
be used very selectively as the benefit in contemporary practice with modern staging is uncertain.

a Micro-boost to MRI-dominant disease improved biochemical control in patients with

intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer in a randomized phase III study in the setting of
conventionally fractionated EBRT. If using micro-boost, it is critical to restrict dose to OARs
to meet constraints that would normally have been achieved without such boost, sacrificing
dose coverage of the boost as needed. Further, careful IGRT and delivery procedures
should be developed in line with the technical demands of this approach. Kerkmeijer LGW,
et al. J Clin Oncol 2021;39:787-796.

b Prophylactic nodal radiotherapy (PNRT): The addition of PNRT in non-metastatic prostate
cancer has not demonstrated consistent benefit in unselected populations. PNRT reduced
relapse and distant/regional progression in one randomized trial focusing on patients with
high-risk features and negative metabolic (PET PSMA) staging imaging. While awaiting
pending trial data to mature in other cohorts, the Panel recommends PNRT in patients
with high-risk and regionally metastatic (cN+) prostate cancer, while deferring to physician
discretion according to patient-specific factors in those with intermediate-risk disease.
PNRT should not used in patients with lower risk disease. Murthy V, et al. J Clin Oncol
2021;39:1234-1242.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY

• Regional disease
Prostate, seminal vesicle, and nodal radiation should be performed. Clinically positive nodes should be dose-escalated as dose-volume histogram
parameters allow. ADT is required unless medically contraindicated. The addition of abiraterone is preferred (see PROS-8 and  PROS-G 1 of 6).

• Low metastatic burden, castration-sensitive disease
RT to the prostate should be considered in patients with lower metastatic burden castration-sensitive metastatic disease according to CT, MRI, and

bone scans when added to ADT. The definition of this cohort is evolving with study updates, concurrent use of intensified systemic therapies, and the
introduction of advanced PET imaging. The strongest data are for a benefit of adding RT in patients receiving either ADT alone, ADT+ docetaxel, or ADT +
abiraterone for those with <4 bony metastases but should be noted to favor a benefit for up to 7 bony metastases, as reviewed:
 ◊ High metastatic burden originally was defined according to the CHAARTED trial using CT, MRI, and bone scans by presence of visceral metastasis OR
≥4 bone metastasis with at least one outside the vertebral bodies or pelvis. Low metastatic burden disease is defined by lesser volume or extent of
disease than high burden. Metastatic burden thus is defined by CT, MRI, and bone scans, whereas PET imaging should not be used to exclude a patient
from treatment of the primary tumor.

 ◊ This recommendation is based on the STAMPEDE phase 3 randomized trial's Arm H, which randomized 2061 patients to standard systemic therapy
with or without radiotherapy to the primary. The overall cohort had a significant improvement from the addition of radiotherapy to the primary in
failure-free survival (FFS), but not OS. The prespecified low-volume subset had a significant improvement in both FFS and OS.5 A meta-analysis with
two other studies confirmed this benefit for primary RT to the primary tumor in lower volume disease.6

 ◊ A subsequent update of the STAMPEDE study delineated with more granularity who benefits from treatment of the primary more simply based on

number of bone metastases,7 given the practical challenges with using the CHAARTED definition. In this analysis, the survival benefit of primary RT
added to ADT continuously decreased with increasing bone lesion number for up to 7 metastases, with the strongest statistical association remaining
for those with <4 metastases. Thus, CT, MRI, and bone scans defined number of bony metastases without visceral involvement may be preferred to
define candidacy for treatment of the primary tumor.

Minimizing toxicity is paramount when delivering RT to the primary in patients with metastatic disease. As such, it is unclear if routine treatment of

regional nodes in addition to the primary tumor or if substantial dose escalation beyond regimens used in prospective studies such as STAMPEDE Arm H
improves outcomes; nodal treatment should be performed in the context of a clinical trial.

Brachytherapy is not recommended outside of a clinical trial, as safety and efficacy have not been established in this patient population.
At present, the use of primary RT cannot be used in itself to omit ADT intensification, and conversely, the use of ADT intensification does not clearly

obviate the benefit of primary RT.

• High-metastatic burden
RT to the prostate should NOT be used in patients with high-volume metastatic disease outside the context of a clinical trial unless for palliative intent.
This recommendation is based on two randomized trials, HORRAD and STAMPEDE, neither of which showed an improvement in OS from the addition of

radiotherapy to the primary when combined with standard systemic therapy.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY

Radiotherapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Definitive Radiotherapy:
See Principles of Local Secondary Post-Recurrence Therapy (PROS-K)

Post-Prostatectomy Radiation Therapy
• The Panel recommends use of nomograms and consideration of age and

comorbidities, clinical and pathologic information, PSA levels, PSADT, and
22-gene GC molecular assay to individualize treatment discussion.

•  Postoperative radiotherapy should be instituted in patients with sufficient

life expectancy when an undetectable PSA becomes subsequently
detectable and increases on two measurements or when a PSA remains
persistently detectable after RP. Treatment is more effective when
pretreatment PSA is low and PSADT is long. This is based on trial data, as
reviewed:
Historically, indications for adjuvant RT based on randomized trial data

include pT3a disease, positive margin(s), or seminal vesicle involvement,
regardless of PSA status. Adjuvant RT is usually given within 1 year after
RP and after operative side effects have improved/stabilized.
Currently, for most patients, institution of early postoperative

radiotherapy for rising serum PSA levels at low levels is associated
with best cancer control outcomes and minimization of overtreatment.
This is based upon a meta-analysis of three randomized studies in
which adjuvant RT was not superior in event-free survival, compared
to institution of early postoperative radiotherapy at low PSA (eg, after
confirmation of ≥0.1–0.2 ng/mL).8

Notably, these studies did not well-represent patients with very-high-risk
features such as nodal involvement or particularly adverse features,
where individualized risk-based decision-making should be favored.
Use of ADT: Selection for ADT addition to postoperative RT continues
to evolve based on clinicopathologic, patient-specific, and GC-based
selection factors. Patients with high 22-gene GC scores (GC >0.6) should
be strongly considered for the addition of ADT to EBRT, particularly
when the opportunity for early EBRT has been missed. Data for ADT use
in patients with rising PSA after prostatectomy without metastases or
pathologic lymph node involvement is detailed:

EBRT with 2 years of 150 mg/day of bicalutamide demonstrated improved

OS and MFS on a prospective randomized trial (RTOG 9601) versus
radiation alone in the secondary treatment setting. A secondary analysis
of RTOG 9601 found that patients with PSA ≤0.6 ng/mL had no OS

improvement with the addition of the antiandrogen to EBRT. In addition,
results of a retrospective analysis of RP specimens from patients in
RTOG 9601 suggest that those with low PSA and a low GC score derived
less benefit (development of distant metastases, OS) from bicalutamide
than those with a high GC score.9,10

EBRT with 6 months of ADT (LHRH agonist) improved biochemical
or clinical progression at 5 years on a prospective randomized trial
(GETUG-16) versus radiation alone in patients with rising PSA levels
between 0.2 and 2.0 ng/mL after RP.11

The SPPORT (RTOG 0534) trial included patients with PSA levels between
0.1 and 2.0 ng/mL after RP. The primary outcome measure of freedom
from progression was 70.9% at 5 years (95% CI, 67.0–74.9) for those who
received RT to the prostate bed and 81.3% (95% CI, 78.0–84.6) for those
who also received 4–6 months of ADT (LHRH agonist plus antiandrogen).
In a group that received RT to pelvic lymph nodes and the prostate bed
and 4–6 months of ADT, freedom from progression at 5 years was 87.4%
(95% CI, 84.7–90.2).12

• Evidence supports offering adjuvant/secondary RT in most patients

with adverse pathologic features or detectable PSA and no evidence of
disseminated disease.

• Typical prescribed doses for adjuvant RT or secondary post-prostatectomy

RT for rising PSA are 64–72 Gy in standard fractionation. Biopsy-
proven and/or imaging-defined gross recurrence may require higher
doses. Notably, randomized trial data for those without gross evident
disease demonstrated no benefit but higher physician-reported toxicity
with dose escalation for 70 Gy versus 64 Gy.13 Treatment volumes and
OAR tolerances thus should be carefully considered and prioritized.
Hypofractionated post-prostatectomy RT to the prostate fossa alone is
supported by toxicity and outcome equipoise in post-hoc evaluation of the
RADICALS-RT trial14 (52.5 Gy/20 fractions vs. 66 Gy/33 fractions) and in the
2-year report of the NRG GU003 trial (62.5 Gy/25 fractions vs. 66.6 Gy/37
fractions).15 However, the Panel notes that these regimens have shorter
follow-up than historically studied conventionally fractionated regimens
and a relative paucity of data for simultaneous integrated treatment of the
pelvic lymph nodes.

• Nuclear medicine advanced imaging techniques with improved sensitivity
can be useful for localizing disease with PSA levels at low absolute levels,
as low as 0.2 ng/mL (Discussion).

• Target volumes include the prostate bed and may include the pelvic nodes

according to physician discretion.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY

Radiopharmaceutical Therapy
• Radiopharmaceutical therapies for prostate cancer are suitable options for improving survival and/or PFS in select patients with advanced castration-

resistant disease. Due to prior therapy exposure, specific targets, and hematologic effects of these therapies, careful selection and sequencing strategy
with other therapies is important. This section discusses the two currently FDA-approved agents in use (Ra-223, Lu-177–PSMA-617).

• Radium-223 is an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical that has been shown to extend survival in patients who have CRPC with symptomatic bone

metastases, but no visceral metastases. Radium-223 alone has not been shown to extend survival in patients with visceral metastases or bulky nodal
disease (>3–4 cm). Radium-223 causes double-strand DNA breaks and has a short radius of activity.
Radium-223 is administered IV once a month for 6 months by an appropriately licensed facility. Concurrent use with systemic therapies other than ADT

should be pursued only on clinical trial due to potential for myelosuppression.

Hematologic toxicities: Selection includes verification of baseline marrow reserve by CBC testing per label. Grade 3–4 hematologic toxicity (ie, 2%

neutropenia, 3% thrombocytopenia, 6% anemia) occurs at low frequency. Verification of suitable counts per label prior to subsequent doses is important,
and extended delays without sufficient recovery (eg, >6–8 weeks) should lead to discontinuation.

Bone fracture risk: Radium-223 may increase fracture risk when given concomitantly with abiraterone acetate/prednisone. Concomitant use of

denosumab or zoledronic acid is recommended; it does not interfere with the beneficial effects of radium-223 on survival.

• Lu-177–PSMA-61714
Lu-177–PSMA-617 is a beta-emitting radiopharmaceutical that selectively binds to PSMA receptors on prostate cancer cells. In patients with PSMA-
positive disease, Lu-177–PSMA-617 has been shown to improve OS in patients with progressive mCRPC previously treated with androgen receptor
inhibitors and taxane chemotherapy.

Lu-177–PSMA-617 is not recommended in patients with dominant PSMA-negative lesions. PSMA-negative lesions are defined as metastatic disease that
lacks PSMA uptake including bone with soft tissue components ≥1.0 cm, lymph nodes ≥2.5 cm in short axis, and solid organ metastases ≥1.0 cm in size.

Lu-177–PSMA-617 is typically administered IV 200 mCi (7.4 GBq) every 6 weeks for a total of 6 treatments by an appropriately licensed facility, usually
in nuclear medicine or RT departments. Patients should be well-hydrated during treatment. Because Lu-177 also emits gamma radiation, appropriate
precautions should be taken to minimize exposure to personnel administering the radiopharmaceutical. Treatment rooms should be monitored for
potential contamination following treatments, and patients should be provided written instructions regarding radiation safety precautions following
treatment.

The most frequently reported side effects from Lu-177–PSMA-617 include fatigue (43%), dry mouth (39%), nausea (35%), and anemia (32%).
Although the FDA has approved Ga-68 PSMA-11 for use with Lu-177–PSMA-617, the Panel believes that F-18 piflufolastat PSMA and F-18 flotufolastat

PSMA can also be used in the same space due to multiple reports describing the equivalency of these imaging agents in:
 ◊ PSMA molecular recognition motifs,
 ◊ normal organ biodistribution, and
 ◊ detection accuracy of prostate cancer lesions.

Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection
• For patients undergoing RP:
Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) can be considered in patients

with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

PLND is recommended in patients with unfavorable intermediate,

high, very-high-risk, and regional prostate cancer.

A PLND can be excluded in patients with low predicated probability

Radical Prostatectomy
• RP is an appropriate therapy for any patient not on an active

surveillance program with clinically localized prostate cancer that
can be completely excised surgically, who has a life expectancy of
≥10 years, and who has no serious comorbid conditions that would
contraindicate an elective operation.

• High-volume surgeons in high-volume centers generally provide

of nodal metastases by nomograms, although some patients
with lymph node metastases will be missed. There is no single
evidence-based threshold for performing PLND. Based on the
risk of complications with PLND and extra time to perform the
procedure, the published thresholds range from 2% to 7%.2-5
A patient who is above the threshold for performing a PLND, but
has a negative PSMA PET scan should still undergo PLND. In
two studies, the sensitivity of PSMA PET for pelvic lymph node
involvement among patients undergoing RP and PLND was low
(about 40%), and the negative predictive value was about 81%.6,7
Thus, basing the decision to perform PLND on a negative PSMA
PET scan could result in missing 19% of patients with positive
lymph nodes.

PLND can be performed using an open, laparoscopic, or robotic

technique.

• Extended PLND provides more complete staging and may cure

better outcomes.

• Blood loss can be substantial with RP, but can be reduced by using

laparoscopic or robotic assistance or by careful control of the
dorsal vein complex and periprostatic vessels when performed as
open surgery.

• Urinary incontinence can be reduced by preservation of urethral
length beyond the apex of the prostate and avoiding damage to
the distal sphincter mechanism. Bladder neck preservation may
decrease the risk of incontinence. Anastomotic strictures increase
the risk of long-term incontinence.

• Recovery of erectile function is directly related to age at RP,

preoperative erectile function, and the degree of preservation of the
cavernous nerves. Replacement of resected nerves with nerve grafts
has not been shown to be beneficial. Early restoration of erections
may improve late recovery.

some patients with microscopic metastases; therefore, an extended
PLND is preferred when PLND is performed.

Secondary Radical Prostatectomy
• Secondary RP is an option for highly selected patients with local

• An extended PLND includes removal of all node-bearing tissue

from an area bound by the external iliac vein anteriorly, the pelvic
sidewall laterally, the bladder wall medially, the floor of the pelvis
posteriorly, Cooper's ligament distally, and the internal iliac artery
proximally.

• While PLND at the time of RP has not been shown to improve
oncologic outcomes, it can provide staging and prognostic
information.1

recurrence after external beam RT (EBRT), brachytherapy, or
cryotherapy in the absence of metastases, but the morbidity (ie,
incontinence, loss of erection, anastomotic stricture) is high and the
operation should be performed by surgeons who are experienced
with secondary RP.

Local Secondary Therapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Definitive Radiotherapy:

PRINCIPLES OF LOCAL SECONDARY THERAPY POST-RADIATION

• Patients with biopsy-proven recurrence in the prostate after prior RT and without distant metastatic disease can be considered for local

therapy.

• The Panel recommends that patients receive multidisciplinary counseling about the risks and benefits of each of these options in the context

of the available comparative literature on this topic.1,2

• Local therapy options for patients with recurrence in the prostate only include:
RP + PLND
Non-surgical strategies

 ◊  Cryotherapy
 ◊ High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) (category 2B)
 ◊  Reirradiation

• Local therapy options for patients with recurrence in the regional nodes with or without prostate recurrence include:
ADT + pelvic lymph node radiation (if not previously done)
ADT + pelvic lymph node reirradiation (category 2B)
ADT + PLND (category 2B)
Pelvic lymph node radiation
PLND
• Reirradiation options include LDR brachytherapy, HDR brachytherapy, and SBRT.1-7
• There is no consensus as to the most appropriate reirradiation volume, and there are published experiences for both focal/partial and whole
gland reirradiation. The Panel recommends that patients receiving local therapy for RT recurrence are treated within the context of clinical
trials when available and/or at experienced centers.

PRINCIPLES OF NON-HORMONAL SYSTEMIC THERAPY

• An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines.

Non-Hormonal Systemic Therapy for M1 Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
• Patients with low-volume synchronous or high-volume castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer who are fit for chemotherapy should
be considered for triplet therapy with ADT, certain androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs), and docetaxel based on phase 3 studies:
ADT with docetaxel and abiraterone was compared to ADT alone or with docetaxel in an open-label, randomized, phase 3 study.

Radiographic PFS was longer in patients who received abiraterone than in those who did not. The populations receiving the triplet and
doublet therapies experienced similar rates of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and neuropathy, although grade ≥3 adverse events
occurred in 63% of patients who received the triplet combination compared with 52% of those receiving ADT and docetaxel.

ADT with docetaxel and darolutamide was compared with ADT with docetaxel and placebo in a randomized phase 3 trial. OS, time to

CRPC, skeletal event-free survival, and time to initiation of subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy were improved in the patients who
received darolutamide. Adverse events of any grade, grade 3 to 5 adverse events, and serious adverse events occurred at similar incidence
levels between the two arms. Many of these were known effects of docetaxel. Exceptions were rash (16.6% vs. 13.5%) and hypertension
(13.7% vs. 9.2%), which are known effects of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors and were more frequent in the darolutamide group.
An open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial compared ADT with enzalutamide to ADT with a first-generation antiandrogen in this setting.
Concurrent docetaxel was allowed and used for stratification. OS was improved with the use of enzalutamide over first-generation
antiandrogen regardless of the addition of docetaxel. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia associated with
docetaxel use (6% in both groups), fatigue (1% in the control group vs. 6% in the enzalutamide group), and hypertension (6% vs. 10%). The
incidence of grade 1–3 memory impairment was 4% versus 13%.

• The use of myeloid growth factors should follow the NCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors, based on risk of neutropenic fever.

PRINCIPLES OF NON-HORMONAL SYSTEMIC THERAPY

Non-Hormonal Systemic Therapy for M1 CRPC
• Chemotherapy
Docetaxel with concurrent steroid

 ◊ Concurrent steroid includes daily prednisone, which may be omitted
on the day of chemotherapy administration when dexamethasone is
given.

 ◊ Every-3-week docetaxel with concurrent steroid is the preferred

first-line chemotherapy treatment based on phase 3 clinical trial data
for patients with symptomatic mCRPC. Adverse events associated
with docetaxel include neutropenia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia,
neutropenic infections, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reaction,
hepatic function impairment, neuropathy, and other low-grade adverse
events (eg, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, alopecia, diarrhea).

 ◊ Only regimens utilizing docetaxel on an every-3-week schedule

demonstrated beneficial impact on survival. The duration of therapy
should be based on the assessment of benefit and toxicities. In the
pivotal trials establishing survival advantage of docetaxel-based
chemotherapy, patients received up to 10 cycles of treatment if no
progression and no prohibitive toxicities were noted.

response, and radiologic response when compared with mitoxantrone
and prednisone and is FDA approved in the post-docetaxel second-
line setting. Toxicity at this dose was significant and included
febrile neutropenia, severe diarrhea, fatigue, nausea/vomiting,
anemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis, and renal failure. A recent trial,
PROSELICA, compared cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² every 3 weeks to 20
mg/m² every 3 weeks. Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m² had less toxicity; febrile
neutropenia, diarrhea, and fatigue were less frequent. Cabazitaxel
at 20 mg/m² had a significantly lower PSA response rate but non-
significantly lower radiographic response rate and non-significantly
shorter PFS and OS (13.4 months vs. 14.5 months) compared to 25
mg/m².

 ◊ Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 with concurrent steroid improved

radiographic PFS and reduced the risk of death compared with
abiraterone or enzalutamide in patients with prior docetaxel treatment
for mCRPC in the CARD study.

 ◊ No chemotherapy regimen to date has demonstrated improved
survival or quality of life after cabazitaxel, and trial participation
should be encouraged.

 ◊ Docetaxel retreatment can be attempted after progression on a novel

Cabazitaxel/carboplatin with concurrent steroid

hormone therapy in patients with mCRPC whose cancer has not
demonstrated definitive evidence of progression on prior docetaxel
therapy in the castration-sensitive setting.

Cabazitaxel with concurrent steroid

 ◊ Concurrent steroid includes daily prednisone, which may be omitted
on the day of chemotherapy administration when dexamethasone is
given.

 ◊ Patients who are not candidates for docetaxel or who are intolerant
of docetaxel should be considered for cabazitaxel with concurrent
steroid, based on results that suggest clinical activity of cabazitaxel
in mCRPC. Cabazitaxel was associated with lower rates of peripheral
neuropathy than docetaxel, particularly at 20 mg/m2 (12% vs. 25%)
and may be appropriate in patients with pre-existing mild peripheral
neuropathy. Current data do not support greater efficacy of
cabazitaxel over docetaxel.

 ◊ Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m² with concurrent steroid has been shown

in a randomized phase 3 study (TROPIC) to prolong OS, PFS, PSA

 ◊ Concurrent steroid includes daily prednisone, which may be omitted
on the day of chemotherapy administration when dexamethasone is
given.

 ◊ Cabazitaxel 20 or 25 mg/m² plus carboplatin AUC 4 mg/mL per minute
with growth factor support can be considered for fit patients with
aggressive variant mCRPC (ie, visceral metastases, low PSA and
bulky disease, high LDH, high CEA, lytic bone metastases, NEPC
histology) or unfavorable genomics (defects in at least 2 of PTEN,
TP53, and RB1). The most common grade 3 to 5 adverse events were
fatigue, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Corn PG, et al.
Lancet Oncol 2019;20:1432-1443.
 – Cabazitaxel starting dose can be either 20 mg/m² or 25 mg/m² for
patients with mCRPC whose cancer has progressed despite prior
docetaxel chemotherapy. Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² with concurrent
steroid may be considered for healthy patients who wish to be more
aggressive. Growth factor support may be needed with either dose.

PRINCIPLES OF NON-HORMONAL SYSTEMIC THERAPY

• Chemotherapy (continued)
Mitoxantrone with prednisone

 ◊ Mitoxantrone with prednisone may provide palliation but has not been
shown to extend survival in two randomized trials. Adverse events
associated with mitoxantrone are similar to docetaxel, but with lower
rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenic fevers, cardiovascular events, nausea
and vomiting, metabolic disturbances, and neurologic events.
Increasing PSA should not be used as the sole criteria for progression.
Assessment of response should incorporate clinical and radiographic
criteria.

See NCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors for

recommendations on growth factor support.

• PARP Inhibitors With or Without Novel Hormone Therapies
Loss of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be especially associated with response

to PARP inhibitor therapy compared to other HRR gene alterations.

Olaparib is an option for patients with mCRPC who have an HRR mutation

and whose cancer has progressed on prior treatment with androgen
receptor-directed therapy regardless of prior docetaxel therapy based on
results of a randomized phase 3 study in patients with HRR mutations.
Radiographic PFS was improved over physician's choice of abiraterone
or enzalutamide. Efficacy appears to be driven by the cohort of patients
with at least one alteration in BRCA2, BRCA1, or ATM, and in particular
by patients with BRCA2 or BRCA1 mutations based on exploratory gene-
by-gene analysis. There may be heterogeneity of response to olaparib for
non-BRCA mutations based on the specific gene mutation (Discussion).
In the pre-docetaxel setting, olaparib is a preferred treatment option for
patients with a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in BRCA1
or BRCA2, and is also an option in this setting for patients with other
HRR gene alterations (ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2,
FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L). Adverse events
that may occur with olaparib treatment include anemia (including that
requiring transfusion), fatigue, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss,
diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, creatinine elevation, cough,
and dyspnea. Rare but serious side effects may include thromboembolic
events (including pulmonary emboli), drug-induced pneumonitis, and a
theoretical risk of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia.

Rucaparib is an option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1
or BRCA2 mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been treated with
androgen receptor-directed therapy based on results from a randomized
phase 3 trial that showed that the median duration of imaging-based
PFS was significantly longer in the group that received rucaparib than in
those who received a control medication (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or
docetaxel). In the pre-docetaxel setting, rucaparib is a preferred option for
patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Adverse events that may occur
with rucaparib include anemia (including that requiring transfusion),
fatisgue, asthenia, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea
or constipation, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, increased creatinine,
increased liver transaminases, and rash. Rare but serious side effects of
rucaparib include a theoretical risk of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid
leukemia, as well as fetal teratogenicity.

Olaparib with abiraterone is an option for certain patients with mCRPC
(PROS-16) and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (germline and/
or somatic) who have not yet received a novel hormone therapy based
on results of an international, double-blind, phase 3 trial. Imaging-based
PFS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population was significantly longer in
the olaparib group than in the placebo group. The safety profile of the
olaparib/abiraterone combination was as expected based on the known
safety profiles of the individual drugs, with the most common adverse
events being anemia, fatigue/asthenia, and nausea.

• PARP Inhibitors With or Without Novel Hormone Therapies (continued)
Talazoparib plus enzalutamide is a treatment option for patients with

mCRPC and a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in an HRR
gene (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, ATR, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, MLH1, MRE11A,
NBN, PALB2, or RAD51C) who have not yet had treatment in the setting of
CRPC, depending on prior treatment in other disease settings (PROS-16)
based on results from a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial. Median
radiographic PFS was improved in the talazoparib group compared with
the control group. The safety profile of enzalutamide plus talazoparib
was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual drugs,
with the most common adverse events in those who received talazoparib
being anemia, neutropenia, and fatigue. However, hematologic adverse
events were of higher grades and occurred more frequently than would be

PRINCIPLES OF NON-HORMONAL SYSTEMIC THERAPY

expected with talazoparib alone. There may be heterogeneity of response
based on the specific gene mutation (Discussion). Use of talazoparib/
enzalutamide for those who have received prior novel hormone therapy
is controversial because a benefit of this combination over use of a PARP
inhibitor alone has not been shown in this setting, but responses are
likely.

Niraparib plus abiraterone (combination tablet) is a treatment option

for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation
(germline and/or somatic) who have not yet had treatment in the setting
of mCRPC, depending on prior treatment in other disease settings
(PROS-16) based on results of a randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial.
Radiographic PFS was improved for those receiving niraparib in the
HRR mutation group overall and in the BRCA mutation subgroup. The
incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was higher in the niraparib group
than in the placebo group, with anemia and hypertension as the most
reported grade ≥3 adverse events. Use of niraparib/abiraterone for those
who have received prior novel hormone therapy is controversial because
a benefit of this combination over use of a PARP inhibitor alone has not
been shown in this setting, but responses are likely.
 ◊ The fine-particle (category 2B; other recommended option) or standard
formulation of abiraterone can be given with single-agent niraparib as
a substitute for the combination niraparib/abiraterone tablet.

• Immunotherapy
Patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC may

consider immunotherapy.

Sipuleucel-T

 ◊ Sipuleucel-T is only for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic
patients with no liver metastases, life expectancy >6 months, and
ECOG performance status 0–1.

 ◊ Sipuleucel-T is not recommended for patients with small cell prostate

cancer/NEPC.

 ◊ Sipuleucel-T has been shown in a phase 3 clinical trial to extend mean
survival from 21.7 months in the control arm to 25.8 months in the
treatment arm, which constitutes a 22% reduction in mortality risk.
 ◊ Sipuleucel-T is well-tolerated; common complications include chills,

pyrexia, and headache.

Pembrolizumab is an option for certain patients with mCRPC and MSI-H,

dMMR, or TMB ≥10 mut/Mb (PROS-16).
 ◊ Pembrolizumab may cause severe, life-threatening immune-

mediated adverse reactions, which may include but are not limited
to: pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, myocarditis, endocrinopathies,
exfoliative dermatologic conditions, renal failure and nephritis,
and ocular toxicities. See NCCN Guidelines for Management of
Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities.

• Other Targeted Agents
Pan-cancer, tumor-agnostic treatments can be considered for patients

with actionable mutations.

but not to sarcoma or transitional cell (urothelial) carcinoma of the prostate.
Adjectives used to describe histologic variants of adenocarcinomas of
prostate include mucinous, signet ring cell, ductal, and neuroendocrine,
including small cell carcinoma. There should be histologic confirmation of the
disease.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Overview

An estimated 288,300 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in
the United States in 2023, accounting for 29% of new cancer cases in
men.1 It is the most common cancer in men in the United States, who
currently have a 1 in 8 lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer.1 The
incidence of prostate cancer declined by approximately 40% from 2007 to
2014, but since that time has increased at a rate of 3% annually. This
increase is driven by a rise in the diagnosis of regional and metastatic
disease, which may be a result of declining rates of prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) testing that followed the 2012 USPSTF recommendations
against testing.2-10

Researchers further estimate that prostate cancer will account for 11% of
male cancer deaths in the United States in 2023, with an estimated 34,700
deaths.1 The age-adjusted death rate from prostate cancer declined by
52% from 1993 to 2017, but the death rate has become more stable in
recent years, with a 0.6% annual decrease from 2013 through 2020.1 For
all stages combined, the 5-year relative survival rate for prostate cancer is
97%.1 The comparatively low death rate suggests that increased public
awareness with earlier detection and treatment has affected mortality from
this prevalent cancer, but is also complicated by screening-related lead-
time bias and detection of indolent cancers. Maintenance of this low death
rate is threatened by the rising prostate cancer incidence and diagnosis of
advanced disease.

Unfortunately, large inequities exist in incidence of and mortality from
prostate cancer across racial and ethnic groups. The incidence rate in
Black individuals is 70% higher than in white individuals, and the mortality
rate in this population is two to four times higher than all other racial and
ethnic groups.1 In addition, the mortality rate for American Indian/Alaska
Native populations is higher than for white individuals.

The USPSTF released updated recommendations in 2018 that include
individualized, informed decision-making regarding prostate cancer
screening in males aged 55 to 69 years.11 These updated
recommendations may allow for a more balanced approach to prostate
cancer early detection, and evidence suggests that PSA testing rates
increased after the USPSTF’s draft statement was released in 2017.12
Better use of PSA for early detection of potentially fatal prostate cancer
coupled with the use of imaging and biomarkers to improve the specificity
of screening should decrease the risk of overdetection (see the NCCN
Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection, available at
www.NCCN.org). This reduced overdetection along with the use of active
surveillance in appropriate patients should reduce overtreatment AND
preserve the relatively low rates of prostate cancer mortality.

Guidelines Update Methodology

The complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN
Guidelines are available at www.NCCN.org.

Literature Search Criteria

Prior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer, an
electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key
literature in prostate cancer published since the previous Guidelines
update, using the search term “prostate cancer.” The PubMed database
was chosen because it remains the most widely used resource for medical
literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature.13

The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans
published in English. Results were confined to the following article types:
Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Guideline; Practice
Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic
Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key PubMed articles as
well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

guidelines as discussed by the panel during the Guidelines update have
been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations
for which high-level evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of
lower-level evidence and expert opinion.

Sensitive/Inclusive Language Usage

NCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of
equity, inclusion, and representation.14 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use
language that is person-first; not stigmatizing; anti-racist, anti-classist, anti-
misogynist, anti-ageist, anti-ableist, and anti-weight-biased; and inclusive
of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN
Guidelines incorporate non-gendered language, instead focusing on
organ-specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate
and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of
all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will
continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing
statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do
not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender
data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently.
If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs
present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender
individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in
future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate
language in their future analyses.

Initial Prostate Cancer Diagnosis

Initial suspicion of prostate cancer is based on an abnormal digital rectal
exam (DRE) or an elevated PSA level. A separate NCCN Guidelines
Panel has written guidelines for prostate cancer early detection (see the
NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Early Detection, available at
www.NCCN.org). Definitive diagnosis requires biopsies of the prostate,
usually performed by a urologist using a needle under transrectal

ultrasound (TRUS) guidance. A pathologist assigns a Gleason primary
and secondary grade to the biopsy specimen. Clinical staging is based on
the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification from the AJCC Staging
Manual, Eighth Edition.15 NCCN treatment recommendations are based on
risk stratification that includes TNM staging rather than on AJCC
prognostic grouping.

Pathology synoptic reports (protocols) are useful for reporting results from
examinations of surgical specimens; these reports assist pathologists in
providing clinically useful and relevant information. The NCCN Guidelines
Panel favors pathology synoptic reports from the College of American
Pathologists (CAP) that comply with the Commission on Cancer (CoC)
requirements.16

Estimates of Life Expectancy

Estimates of life expectancy have emerged as a key determinant of
primary treatment, particularly when considering active surveillance or
observation. Life expectancy can be estimated for groups of individuals,
but it is difficult to extrapolate these estimates to an individual patient. Life
expectancy can be estimated using the Minnesota Metropolitan Life
Insurance Tables, the Social Security Administration Life Insurance
Tables,17 the WHO’s Life Tables by Country,18 or the Memorial Sloan
Kettering Male Life Expectancy tool19 and adjusted for individual patients
by adding or subtracting 50% based on whether one believes the patient is
in the healthiest quartile or the unhealthiest quartile, respectively.20 As an
example, the Social Security Administration Life Expectancy for a 65-year-
old American male is 17.7 years. If judged to be in the upper quartile of
health, a life expectancy of 26.5 years is assigned. If judged to be in the
lower quartile of health, a life expectancy of 8.8 years is assigned. Thus,
treatment recommendations could change dramatically using the NCCN
Guidelines if a 65-year-old patient was judged to be in either poor or
excellent health.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Prostate Cancer Genetics

Homologous DNA Repair Genes

Family history of prostate cancer raises the risk of prostate cancer.21-24 In
addition, prostate cancer has been associated with hereditary breast and
ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome (due to germline mutations in
homologous DNA repair genes) and Lynch syndrome (resulting from
germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair [MMR] genes).24-29 In fact,
approximately 11% of patients with prostate cancer and at least 1
additional primary cancer carry germline mutations associated with
increased cancer risk.30 Therefore, the panel recommends a thorough
review of personal and family history for all patients with prostate
cancer.31,32

The newfound appreciation of the frequency of germline mutations has
implications for family genetic counseling, cancer risk syndromes, and
assessment of personal risk for subsequent cancers. Some patients with
prostate cancer and their families may be at increased risk for breast and
ovarian cancer, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer (HBOC); colorectal
cancers (Lynch syndrome); and other cancer types. Data also suggest that
patients with prostate cancer who have BRCA1/2 germline mutations have
increased risk of progression on local therapy and decreased overall
survival (OS).33-35 This information should be discussed with such patients
if they are considering active surveillance. Finally, there are possible
treatment implications for patients with DNA repair defects (see Treatment
Options for Patients with DNA Repair Gene Mutations, below).

Prostate cancer is often associated with somatic mutations that occur in
the tumor but not in the germline. An estimated 89% of metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tumors contain a potentially
actionable mutation, with only about 9% of these occurring in the
germline.36 Both germline and tumor mutations are discussed herein.

Somatic mutations in DNA repair pathway genes occur in up to 19% of
localized prostate tumors and 23% of metastatic CRPC tumors, with most
mutations found in BRCA2 and ATM.36,37 These tumor mutations are often
associated with germline mutations. For example, 42% of patients with
metastatic CRPC and somatic mutations in BRCA2 were found to carry
the mutation in their germlines.36 In localized prostate cancer, that number
was 60%.37

Overall, germline DNA repair mutations have been reported with the
lowest frequencies seen in patients with lower-risk localized prostate
cancer (1.6%–3.8%), higher frequencies in those with higher-risk localized
disease (6%–8.9%), and the highest frequencies in those with metastatic
disease (7.3%–16.2%).36,38-44 One study found that 11.8% of patients with
metastatic prostate cancer have germline mutations in 1 of 16 DNA repair
genes: BRCA2 (5.3%), ATM (1.6%), CHEK2 (1.9%), BRCA1 (0.9%),
RAD51D (0.4%), PALB2 (0.4%), ATR (0.3%), and NBN, PMS2, GEN1,
MSH2, MSH6, RAD51C, MRE11A, BRIP1, or FAM175A.43

An additional study showed that 9 of 125 patients with high-risk, very-high-
risk, or metastatic prostate cancer (7.2%) had pathogenic germline
mutations in MUTYH (4), ATM (2), BRCA1 (1), BRCA2 (1), and BRIP1
(1).40 In this study, the rate of metastatic disease among those with a
mutation identified was high (28.6%, 2 of 7 patients). Although having a
relative with breast cancer was associated with germline mutation
identification (P = .035), only 45.5% of the mutation carriers in the study
had mutations that were concordant with their personal and family history.
Another study also found that a family history of breast cancer increased
the chances of identifying a germline DNA repair gene mutation in patients
with prostate cancer (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.33–2.68; P = .003).45 In a study
of an unselected cohort of 3607 patients with a personal history of prostate

Prostate Cancer

cancer who had germline genetic testing based on clinician referral, 11.5%
had germline mutations in BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, BRCA1, or PALB2.46

More than 2% of Ashkenazi Jews carry germline mutations in BRCA1 or
BRCA2, and these carriers have a 16% chance (95% CI, 4%–30%) of
developing prostate cancer by the age of 70.47 In a study of 251
unselected Ashkenazi Jewish patients with prostate cancer, 5.2% had
germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, compared with 1.9% of control
Ashkenazi Jewish males.48

Germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have been associated with an
increased risk for prostate cancer in numerous reports.28,29,48-58 In
particular, BRCA2 mutations have been associated with a 2- to 6-fold
increase in the risk for prostate cancer, whereas the association of BRCA1
mutations and increased risks for prostate cancer are less
consistent.28,29,48,50,52,57,59,60 In addition, limited data suggest that germline
mutations in ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2 increase the risk of prostate
cancer.61-64 Furthermore, prostate cancer in individuals with germline
BRCA mutations (BRCAm) appears to occur earlier, has a more
aggressive phenotype, and is associated with significantly reduced
survival times than in non-carrier patients.34,35,59,65-69

DNA Mismatch Repair Genes

Tumor mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 may result in tumor
microsatellite instability (MSI) and deficient MMR (dMMR; detected by
immunohistochemistry) and are sometimes associated with germline
mutations and Lynch syndrome. Patients with Lynch syndrome may have
an increased risk for prostate cancer. In particular, studies show an
increased risk for prostate cancer in patients who are older and have
germline MSH2 mutations.70,71

In a study of more than 15,000 patients with cancer treated at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who had their tumor and matched normal

DNA sequenced and tumor MSI status assessed, approximately 5% of
1048 patients with prostate cancer had MSI-high (MSI-H) or MSI-
indeterminate tumors, 5.6% of whom were found to have Lynch syndrome
(0.29% of patients with prostate cancer).25 In another prospective case
series, the tumors of 3.1% of 1033 patients with prostate cancer
demonstrated MSI-H/dMMR status, and 21.9% of these patients had
Lynch syndrome (0.68% of the total population).72 In a study of an
unselected cohort of 3607 patients with a personal history of prostate
cancer who had germline genetic testing based on clinician referral, 1.7%
had germline mutations in PMS2, MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6.46

Effect of Intraductal/Cribriform or Ductal Histology

Ductal prostate carcinomas are rare, accounting for approximately 1.3% of
prostate carcinomas.73 Intraductal prostate cancer may be more common,
especially in higher risk groups, and may be associated with a poor
prognosis.74 It is important to note that there is significant overlap in
diagnostic criteria and that intraductal, ductal, and invasive cribriform
features may coexist in the same biopsy. By definition, intraductal
carcinoma includes cribriform proliferation of malignant cells as long as
they remain confined to a preexisting gland that is surrounded by basal
cells. These features are seen frequently with an adjacent invasive
cribriform component and would be missed without the use of basal cell
markers.

Limited data suggest that acinar prostate adenocarcinoma with invasive
cribriform pattern, intraductal carcinoma of prostate (IDC-P), or ductal
adenocarcinoma component y have increased genomic instability.75-78 In
particular, tumors with these histologies may be more likely to harbor
somatic MMR gene alterations than those with adenocarcinoma
histology.78-80 In addition, limited data suggest that germline homologous
DNA repair gene mutations may be more common in prostate tumors of
ductal or intraductal origin81,82 and that intraductal histology is common in

Prostate Cancer

germline BRCA2 mutation carriers with prostate cancer.83 Overall, the
panel believes that the data connecting histology and the presence of
genomic alterations are stronger for intraductal than ductal histology at this
time. Therefore, patients with presence of intraductal carcinoma on biopsy
should have germline testing as described below.

Genetic Testing Recommendations

Germline Testing Based on Family History, Histology, and Risk Groups
The panel recommends inquiring about family and personal history of
cancer and known germline variants at time of initial diagnosis. Germline
testing should be considered in appropriate individuals where it is likely to
impact the prostate cancer treatment and clinical trial options,
management of risk of other cancers, and/or potential risk of cancer in
family members. Based on the data discussed above, the panel
recommends germline genetic testing for patients with prostate cancer and
any of the following31,32:

•  A positive family history (see definition in the guidelines above)
•  High-risk, very-high-risk, regional, or metastatic prostate cancer,

regardless of family history
•  Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry
•  A personal history of breast cancer

In addition, germline genetic testing should be considered in patients with
a personal history of prostate cancer and 1) intermediate-risk prostate
cancer and intraductal/cribriform histology or 2) a personal history of
exocrine pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colorectal, gastric, melanoma,
pancreatic cancer, upper tract urothelial cancer, glioblastoma, biliary tract
cancer, and small intestinal cancer.

Germline testing, when performed, should include MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
and PMS2 (for Lynch syndrome) and the homologous recombination
genes BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2. Additional genes may
be appropriate depending on clinical context. For example, HOXB13 is a

prostate cancer risk gene and, whereas there are not currently clear
therapeutic implications in the advanced disease setting, testing may have
utility for family counseling.84,85

Genetic counseling resources and support are critical, and post-test
genetic counseling is recommended if a germline mutation (pathogenic
variant) is identified. Cascade testing for relatives is critical to inform the
risk for familial cancers in all relatives. Post-test genetic counseling is
recommended if positive family history but no pathogenic variant OR if
only germline variants of unknown significance (VUS) are identified. This
is to ensure accurate understanding of family implications and review
indications for additional testing and/or follow up (including clinical trials of
reclassification). Resources are available to check the known pathologic
effects of genomic variants (eg, https://brcaexchange.org/about/app;
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/). Information regarding germline
mutations in patients with metastatic disease can be used to inform future
treatments or to determine eligibility for clinical trials.

Somatic Tumor Testing Based on Risk Groups
Tumor testing recommendations are as follows:

1.  Tumor testing for somatic homologous recombination gene

mutations (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D,
CHEK2, CDK12) can be considered in patients with regional (N1)
prostate cancer and is recommended for those with metastatic
disease.

2.  Tumor testing for MSI or dMMR can be considered in patients with
regional or metastatic castration-naïve prostate cancer and is
recommended in the metastatic CRPC setting.

3.  Tumor mutational burden (TMB) testing may be considered in

patients with metastatic CRPC.

4.  Multigene molecular testing can be considered for patients with

low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer and life

expectancy ≥10 years (see Tumor Multigene Molecular Testing,
below).

be recommended for genetic counseling and follow-up dedicated germline
testing.

5.  The Decipher molecular assay is recommended to inform adjuvant
treatment if adverse features are found post-radical prostatectomy,
and can be considered as part of counseling for risk stratification in
patients with PSA resistance/recurrence after radical
prostatectomy (category 2B). See Tumor Multigene Molecular
Testing, below).

The panel strongly recommends a metastatic biopsy for histologic and
molecular evaluation. When unsafe or unfeasible, plasma ctDNA assay is
an option, preferably collected during biochemical (PSA) and/or
radiographic progression in order to maximize diagnostic yield. Caution is
needed when interpreting ctDNA-only evaluation due to potential
interference from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP),
which can result in a false-positive biomarker signal.86

If MSI testing is performed, testing using an NGS assay validated for
prostate cancer is preferred.87-89 If MSI-H or dMMR is found, the patient
should be referred for genetic counseling to assess for the possibility of
Lynch syndrome. MSI-H or dMMR indicate eligibility for pembrolizumab for
certain patients with metastatic CRPC (see Pembrolizumab, below).

Post-test genetic counseling is recommended if pathogenic/likely
pathogenic somatic mutations in any gene that has clinical implications if
also identified in germline (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2,
MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2). Post-test genetic counseling to assess for
the possibility of Lynch syndrome is recommended if MSI-H or dMMR is
found. Virtually none of the NGS tests is designed or validated for
germline assessment. Therefore, over-interpretation of germline findings
should be avoided. If a germline mutation is suspected, the patient should

Additional Testing
Tumors from a majority of patients with metastatic CRPC harbor mutations
in genes involved in the androgen receptor signaling pathway.36 Androgen
receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) testing in circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
can be considered to help guide selection of therapy in the post-
abiraterone/enzalutamide metastatic CRPC setting (discussed in more
detail below, under AR-V7 Testing).

Risk Stratification for Clinically Localized Disease

Optimal treatment of prostate cancer requires estimation of risk: How likely
is a given cancer to be confined to the prostate or spread to the regional
lymph nodes? How likely is the cancer to progress or metastasize after
treatment? How likely is adjuvant or post-recurrence radiation to control
cancer after an unsuccessful radical prostatectomy?

NCCN and other risk classification schemas are prognostic and have not
been shown to be predictive of benefit to a specific treatment. Thus,
recommendations of when to offer conservative management versus
radical therapy and the use of short-term versus long-term ADT are based
on expert opinion and estimates of absolute benefit and harm from a given
therapy in the context of NCCN risk groups.

There are newer risk classification schemas that have been shown to
outperform NCCN risk groups,90,91 as well as tools (ie, imaging, gene
expression biomarkers, germline testing) that together improve risk
stratification. These tools should not be ordered reflexively. They are
recommended only when they will have the ability to change management
(eg, active surveillance vs. radical treatment). Improved risk stratification
can better identify patients who may derive greater or lesser absolute
benefit from a given treatment.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

NCCN Risk Groups

The NCCN Guidelines have, for many years, incorporated a risk
stratification scheme that uses a minimum of stage, Gleason grade, and
PSA to assign patients to risk groups. These risk groups are used to select
the appropriate options that should be considered and to predict the
probability of biochemical recurrence after definitive local therapy.92 Risk
group stratification has been published widely and validated, and provides
a better basis for treatment recommendations than clinical stage alone.93,94

A new prostate cancer grading system was developed during the 2014
International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus
Conference.95 Several changes were made to the assignment of Gleason
pattern based on pathology. The new system assigns Grade Groups from
1 to 5, derived from the Gleason score.

•  Grade Group 1: Gleason score ≤6; only individual discrete well-

formed glands

•  Grade Group 2: Gleason score 3+4=7; predominantly well-formed
glands with lesser component of poorly formed/fused/cribriform
glands

•  Grade Group 3: Gleason score 4+3=7; predominantly poorly
formed/fused/cribriform glands with lesser component of well-
formed glands

o  For cases with >95% poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands
or lack of glands on a core or at radical prostatectomy, the
component of <5% well-formed glands is not factored into
the grade.

•  Grade Group 4: Gleason score 4+4=8; 3+5=8; 5+3=8
o  Only poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands; or
o  Predominantly well-formed glands and lesser component
lacking glands (poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands can
be a more minor component); or

o  Predominantly lacking glands and lesser component of

well-formed glands (poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands
can be a more minor component)

•  Grade Group 5: Gleason score 9–10; lack gland formation (or with
necrosis) with or without poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands

o  For cases with >95% poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands
or lack of glands on a core or at radical prostatectomy, the
component of <5% well-formed glands is not factored into
the grade.

Many experts believe that ISUP Grade Groups will enable patients to
better understand their true risk level and thereby limit overtreatment. The
new Grade Group system was validated in two separate cohorts, one of
>26,000 patients and one of 5880 patients, treated for prostate cancer
with either radical prostatectomy or radiation.96,97 Both studies found that
Grade Groups predicted the risk of recurrence after primary treatment. For
instance, in the larger study, the 5-year biochemical recurrence-free
progression probabilities after radical prostatectomy for Grade Groups 1
through 5 were 96% (95% CI, 95–96), 88% (95% CI, 85–89), 63% (95%
CI, 61–65), 48% (95% CI, 44–52), and 26% (95% CI, 23–30), respectively.
The separation between Grade Groups was less pronounced in the
radiation therapy (RT) cohort, likely because of increased use of
neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in
the higher risk groups. In another study of the new ISUP Grade Group
system, all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality were
higher in patients in Grade Group 5 than in those in Grade Group 4.98
Additional studies have supported the validity of this new system.99-104 The
NCCN Panel has accepted the new Grade Group system to inform better
treatment discussions compared to those using Gleason score. Patients
remain divided into very-low-, low-, intermediate-, high-, and very-high-risk
groups.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

The NCCN Guidelines Panel recognized that heterogeneity exists within
each risk group. For example, an analysis of 12,821 patients showed that
those assigned to the intermediate-risk group by clinical stage (T2b–T2c)
had a lower risk of recurrence than those categorized according to
Gleason score (7) or PSA level (10–20 ng/mL).105 A similar trend of
superior recurrence-free survival was observed in patients placed in the
high-risk group by clinical stage (T3a) compared to those assigned by
Gleason score (8–10) or PSA level (>20 ng/mL), although it did not reach
statistical significance. Other studies have reported differences in
outcomes in the high-risk group depending on risk factors or primary
Gleason pattern.106,107 Evidence also shows heterogeneity in the low-risk
group, with PSA levels and percent positive cores affecting pathologic
findings after radical prostatectomy.108,109

In a retrospective study, 1024 patients with intermediate-risk prostate
cancer were treated with radiation with or without neoadjuvant and
concurrent ADT.110 Multivariate analysis revealed that primary Gleason
pattern 4, number of positive biopsy cores ≥50%, and presence of >1
intermediate-risk factors (IRFs; ie, T2b-c, PSA 10–20 ng/mL, Gleason
score 7) were significant predictors of increased incidence of distant
metastasis. The authors used these factors to separate the patients into
unfavorable and favorable intermediate-risk groups and determined that
the unfavorable intermediate-risk group had worse PSA recurrence-free
survival and higher rates of distant metastasis and prostate cancer-
specific mortality than the favorable intermediate-risk group. The use of
active surveillance in patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate
cancer is discussed below (see Active Surveillance in Favorable
Intermediate Risk). The NCCN Panel has included the separation of
intermediate risk group into favorable and unfavorable subsets in their risk
stratification scheme.

Nomograms

The more clinically relevant information that is used in the calculation of
time to PSA recurrence, the more accurate the result. A nomogram is a
predictive instrument that takes a set of input data (variables) and makes
predictions about an outcome. Nomograms predict more accurately for the
individual patient than risk groups, because they combine the relevant
prognostic variables. The Partin tables were the first to achieve
widespread use for counseling patients with clinically localized prostate
cancer.111-114 The tables give the probability (95% CI) that a patient with a
certain clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA will have a cancer of each
pathologic stage. Nomograms can be used to inform treatment decision-
making for patients contemplating active surveillance,115-117 radical
prostatectomy,118-121 neurovascular bundle preservation122-124 or omission of
pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) during radical prostatectomy,125-128
brachytherapy,118,129-131 or external beam RT (EBRT).118,132 Biochemical
progression-free survival (PFS) can be reassessed postoperatively using
age, diagnostic serum PSA, and pathologic grade and stage.118,133-135
Potential success of adjuvant or post-recurrence RT after unsuccessful
radical prostatectomy can be assessed using a nomogram.118,136

None of the current models predicts with perfect accuracy, and only some
of these models predict metastasis117,118,133,137,138 and cancer-specific
death.119,121,139-141 Given the competing causes of mortality, many patients
who sustain PSA recurrence will not live long enough to develop clinical
evidence of distant metastases or to die from prostate cancer. Those with
a short PSA doubling time (PSADT) are at greatest risk of death. Not all
PSA recurrences are clinically relevant; thus, PSADT may be a more
useful measure of risk of death.142 The NCCN Guidelines Panel
recommends that NCCN risk groups be used to begin the discussion of
options for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer and that

information.

with adverse pathology either alone or in combination with clinical
variables.156

Tumor Multigene Molecular Testing

Personalized or precision medicine is a goal for many translational and
clinical investigators. Molecular testing of a tumor offers the potential of
added insight into the “biologic behavior” of a cancer that could thereby aid
in the clinical decision-making. The NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines
Panel strongly advocates for use of life expectancy estimation,
nomograms, and other clinical parameters such as PSA density as the
foundations for augmented clinical decision-making. Whereas risk groups,
life expectancy estimates, and nomograms help inform decisions,
uncertainty about disease progression persists, and this is where the
prognostic multigene molecular testing can have a role.

Clinical utility studies on the tissue-based molecular assays have also
been performed.157-159 One prospective, clinical utility study of 3966
patients newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer found that the
rates of active surveillance increased with use of a tissue-based gene
expression classifier.157 Active surveillance rates were 46.2%, 75.9%, and
57.9% for those whose classifier results were above the specified
threshold, those whose classifier results were below the threshold, and
those who did not undergo genomic testing, respectively (P < .001). The
authors estimate that one additional patient may choose active
surveillance for every nine patients with favorable-risk prostate cancer who
undergo genomic testing.

Several tissue-based molecular assays have been developed in an effort
to improve decision-making in newly diagnosed patients considering active
surveillance and in treated patients considering adjuvant therapy or
treatment for recurrence. Uncertainty about the risk of disease progression
can be reduced if such molecular assays can provide accurate and
reproducible prognostic or predictive information beyond NCCN risk group
assignment and currently available life expectancy tables and nomograms.
Retrospective case cohort studies have shown that these assays provide
prognostic information independent of NCCN or CAPRA risk groups,
which include likelihood of death with conservative management,
likelihood of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy or EBRT,
likelihood of adverse pathologic features after radical prostatectomy, and
likelihood of developing metastasis after operation, definitive EBRT, or
post-recurrence EBRT.143-155 Evaluation of diagnostic biopsy tissue from
patients enrolled in the Canary PASS multicenter active surveillance
cohort suggested that results of a molecular assay were not associated

Another clinical utility study used two prospective registries of patients with
prostate cancer post-radical prostatectomy (n = 3455).158 Results of
molecular testing with Decipher changed management recommendations
for 39% of patients. This study also evaluated clinical benefit in 102
patients. Those who were classified as high risk by the assay had
significantly different 2-year PSA recurrence rates if they received
adjuvant EBRT versus if they did not (3% vs. 25%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.1;
95% CI, 0.0–0.6; P = .013). No differences in 2-year PSA recurrence were
observed between those who did and did not receive adjuvant therapy in
those classified as low or intermediate risk by the assay. Based on these
results, the panel recommends that the Decipher molecular assay should
be used to inform adjuvant treatment if adverse features are found post-
radical prostatectomy.

Several of these assays are available, and four have received positive
reviews by the Molecular Diagnostic Services Program (MolDX) and are
likely to be covered by CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services).

Several other tests are under development, and the use of these assays is
likely to increase in the coming years.

by nomogram prediction of lymph node involvement, pelvic +/- abdominal
imaging.

Table 1 lists these tests in alphabetical order and provides an overview of
each test, populations where each test independently predicts outcome,
and supporting references. These molecular biomarker tests have been
developed with extensive industry support, guidance, and involvement,
and have been marketed under the less rigorous U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regulatory pathway for biomarkers. Although full
assessment of their clinical utility requires prospective randomized clinical
trials, which are unlikely to be done, the panel believes that patients with
low or favorable intermediate disease and life expectancy greater than or
equal to 10 years may consider the use of Decipher, Oncotype DX
Prostate, or Prolaris during initial risk stratification. Patients with
unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk disease and life expectancy
greater than or equal to 10 years may consider the use of Decipher or
Prolaris. In addition, Decipher may be considered to inform adjuvant
treatment if adverse features are found after radical prostatectomy and
during workup for radical prostatectomy PSA persistence or recurrence
(category 2B for the latter setting). Future comparative effectiveness
research may allow these tests and others like them to gain additional
evidence regarding their utility for better risk stratification of patients with
prostate cancer.

Initial Clinical Assessment and Staging Evaluation

For patients with very-low-, low-, and intermediate-risk prostate cancer
and a life expectancy of 5 years or less and without clinical symptoms,
further imaging and treatment should be delayed until symptoms develop,
at which time imaging can be performed and ADT should be given. Those
with a life expectancy less than or equal to 5 years who fall into the high-
or very-high-risk categories should undergo bone imaging and, if indicated

For symptomatic patients and/or those with a life expectancy of greater
than 5 years, bone and soft tissue imaging is appropriate for patients with
unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, and very-high-risk prostate
cancer:

•  Bone imaging can be achieved by conventional technetium-99m-

MDP bone scan.

o  Plain films, CT, MRI, or PET/CT or PET/MRI with F-18
sodium fluoride, C-11 choline, F-18 fluciclovine, Ga-68
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-11, or F-18
piflufolastat PSMA can be considered for equivocal results
on initial bone imaging.

•  Soft tissue imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest can include
chest CT and abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI.
mpMRI is preferred over CT for pelvic staging.

•  Alternatively, Ga-68 PSMA-11 or F-18 piflufolastat PSMA PET/CT
or PET/MRI can be considered for bone and soft tissue (full body)
imaging.

o  Because of the increased sensitivity and specificity of

PSMA-PET tracers for detecting micrometastatic disease
compared to conventional imaging (CT, MRI) at both initial
staging and biochemical recurrence, the Panel does not
feel that conventional imaging is a necessary prerequisite
to PSMA-PET and that PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI
can serve as an equally effective, if not more effective front-
line imaging tool for these patients.

Retrospective evidence suggests that Gleason score and PSA levels are
associated with positive bone scan findings.160 Multivariate analysis of
retrospective data on 643 patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer

who underwent staging CT found that PSA, Gleason score, and clinical T
stage were associated independently with a positive finding (P < .05 for
all).161 mpMRI may detect large and poorly differentiated prostate cancer
(Grade Group ≥2) and detect extracapsular extension (T staging) and is
preferred over CT for abdominal/pelvic staging. mpMRI has been shown to
be equivalent to CT scan for pelvic lymph node evaluation.

See Imaging Techniques below for a more detailed discussion.

Imaging Techniques

Imaging techniques are useful for staging and for detecting metastases
and tumor recurrence. Current clinical imaging techniques for prostate
cancer include conventional radiography (ie, x-rays), ultrasound, CT, MRI,
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT, scintigraphy), and
PET. Some of these modalities have the ability to assess both anatomy
and tumor function/biology. For example, functional MR sequences can be
added to conventional anatomic MR sequences in a clinical examination
such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to assess tumor cellularity or
MR spectroscopy (MRS) to assess tumor metabolism.

Different modalities can also be merged to maximize prostate cancer
assessment. For example, the functional information obtained with PET
can be combined with the spatial and anatomic information with either CT
(ie, PET/CT) or MRI (ie, PET/MRI) to inform about the locations of tumor
foci for diagnosis or therapy response. Another example of the advantage
of combining modalities is MR-ultrasound fusion guided biopsy (eg, MR-
TRUS) where MRI datasets containing information on suspicious lesions
identified by the radiologist are used by the urologist to navigate
ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate for more accurate diagnosis.162
More details on each technique are outlined in the algorithm under
Principles of Imaging.

Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)

The use of mpMRI in the staging and characterization of prostate cancer
has increased in the last few years. mpMRI examinations typically include
three sequences: T2-weighted imaging, DWI, and dynamic contrast
enhancement (DCE) imaging. There has been increased interest in
biparametric imaging that excludes the use of gadolinium contrast in
prostate MRI examinations; however, more data are needed to identify the
risk groups who would benefit most from this approach.163 In general, it is
recommended that mpMRI be performed on a 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic
strength MRI scanner. This is the highest strength scanner in routine
clinical use and provides the best possible evaluation of prostate cancer.

Additional instrumentation can be used, such as an endorectal coil (ERC)
to improve image quality. If a lower strength 1.5T MRI cancer is required
for a patient because of indwelling medical device incompatibility with 3T
MRI, an ERC is recommended. Use of ERC in routine prostate imaging is
controversial. Current data suggest that a 3T exam with ERC may not be
significantly better than a 3T exam without ERC. Moreover, there may not
be a significant difference in image interpretation between a 1.5T with
ERC and 3T without ERC.164 The use of ERC in prostate MRI also
introduces new problems into the clinical workflow including patient
discomfort, prostate distortion, increased scanner time and expense, and
requirement of someone experienced to place the ERC.

Evidence supports the implementation of mpMRI in several aspects of
prostate cancer management.162 First, mpMRI helps detect larger and/or
more poorly differentiated cancers (ie, Grade Group ≥2).165 mpMRI has
been incorporated into MRI-TRUS fusion-targeted biopsy protocols, which
has led to an increase in the diagnosis of high-grade cancers with fewer
biopsy cores, while reducing detection of low-grade and insignificant
cancers.166-168 In fact, a recently published clinical study identified that MRI-
targeted biopsy synergized with conventional systematic biopsy to identify

Prostate Cancer

more clinically significant cancers.169 Second, mpMRI aids in better
assessment of extracapsular extension (T staging), with high negative
predictive values (NPVs) in patients with low-risk disease.170 mpMRI
results may inform decision-making regarding nerve-sparing operation.171
Third, mpMRI is equivalent to CT scan for staging of pelvic lymph
nodes.172,173 Finally, mpMRI outperforms bone scan and targeted x-rays for
detection of bone metastases, with a sensitivity of 98% to 100% and
specificity of 98% to 100% (vs. sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 98%–
100% for bone scan plus targeted x-rays).174

PET Imaging

The use of PET/CT or PET/MRI imaging using tracers other than F-18
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for staging of small-volume recurrent or
metastatic prostate cancer has rapidly expanded in recent years.162
Currently, there are five PET tracers that are FDA approved for use in
patients with prostate cancer: Ga-68 PSMA-11 (PSMA-HBED-CC), F-18
piflufolastat (DCFPyL), C-11 choline, F-18 fluciclovine, and F-18 sodium
fluoride. Although these tracers are approved for the evaluation of patients
with biochemical recurrence, the PSMA tracers Ga-68 PSMA-11 and F-18
piflufolastat are also approved for patients at initial staging with suspected
metastatic disease. Tracer distribution in patients with prostate cancer can
be imaged with either PET/CT or PET/MRI modalities. Although CT and
MRI are equivalent in the assessment of lymphadenopathy, PET/MRI has
the added advantage over PET/CT with enhanced tissue contrast that is
especially important in evaluation of pelvic anatomy and prostate cancer
assessment. Table 2 summarizes the FDA-cleared PET imaging tracers
studied in prostate cancer. F-18 FDG PET should not be used routinely,
because data are limited in patients with prostate cancer and suggest that
its sensitivity is significantly lower than that seen with the above described
tracers.175-177

PSMA-PET refers to a growing body of radiopharmaceuticals that target
prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on the surface of prostate
cells. Because of the high density of PSMA receptors on the surface of
cancer cells relative to adjacent prostate, PSMA-PET has the advantage
of high signal-to-noise relative to adjacent tissues. The mechanistic role of
androgen receptor signaling in PSMA regulation is still being investigated,
as multiple reports in animals and humans suggest that androgen
modulation can affect PSMA expression and may even be dichotomous in
patients with castration-naïve versus castrate-resistant disease.178-180
There are multiple PSMA radiopharmaceuticals at various stages of
investigation. At this time, the NCCN Guidelines only recommend two
PSMA tracers: the currently FDA-approved PSMA agents, F-18
piflufolastat and Ga-68 PSMA-11. F-18 piflufolastat PSMA or Ga-68
PSMA-11 PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered as an alternative to
standard imaging of bone and soft tissue for initial staging, the detection of
biochemically recurrent disease, and as workup for progression with bone
scan plus CT or MRI for the evaluation of bone, pelvis, and abdomen.

Studies suggest that PSMA PET imaging has a higher sensitivity than C-
11 choline or F-18 fluciclovine PET imaging, especially at very low PSA
levels.181-186 The reported sensitivity and specificity for PSMA-11 PET/CT in
the detection of nodal involvement in primary staging of patients with
intermediate-, high-, and very-high-risk disease is 40% and 95%,
respectively.187 The patient-level positive predictive value (PPV) in
detection of lesions in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) is
92%.188 Similarly, the reported sensitivity and specificity for piflufolastat
PET/CT in the detection of nodal involvement in primary staging of
patients with unfavorable intermediate-, high-, and very-high-risk disease
is 31% to 42% and 96% to 99%, respectively.189,190 The patient-level
correct localization rate (CLR; patient-level PPV validated by anatomic
lesion co-localization) for piflufolastat PET/CT is 85% to 87%.191 Thus,
PSMA-11 and piflufolastat are considered equivalent. Because of the

increased sensitivity and specificity of PSMA PET tracers for detecting
micrometastatic disease compared to conventional imaging (CT, MRI) at
both initial staging and biochemical recurrence, the Panel does not feel
that conventional imaging is a necessary prerequisite to PSMA-PET and
that PSMA PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI can serve as an equally effective,
if not more effective front-line imaging tool for these patients.

PET/CT or PET/MRI detect small-volume disease in bone and soft
tissues.192,193 The reported sensitivity and specificity of C-11 choline
PET/CT in restaging patients with biochemical recurrence ranges from
32% to 93% and from 40% to 93%, respectively.194-203 The reported
sensitivity and specificity of F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT ranges from 37% to
90% and from 40% to 100%, respectively.200,204,205 A prospective study
compared F-18 fluciclovine and C-11 choline PET/CT scans in 89 patients,
and agreement was 85%.200 Thus, choline and fluciclovine are considered
equivalent in the evaluation of patients with biochemical recurrence. The
panel believes that F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT or PET/MRI or C-11 choline
PET/CT or PET/MRI may be used in patients with biochemical recurrence
after primary treatment for further soft tissue and/or bone evaluation after
bone scan, chest CT, and abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI.

The use of these PET tracers can lead to changes in clinical management.
The FALCON trial showed that results of F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT in 104
patients with biochemical recurrence after definitive therapy resulted in a
change in disease management for 64% of patients.206 In addition, the
LOCATE trial demonstrated that fluciclovine frequently changed disease
management plans in patients with biochemical recurrence.207 In a similar
fashion, data also show that PSMA PET has the ability to change radiation
treatment planning in 53% (N = 45) of patients with high- and very-high-
risk prostate cancer using PSMA-11 as well as change disease
management in over half of a prospective cohort of 635 patients with

BCR.208,209 However, whether changes to treatment planning because of
PET tracers have an impact on long-term survival remains to be studied.

F-18 sodium fluoride targets osteoblast activity where the fluoride is
deposited into new bone formation, thus limiting use of this agent to the
detection of osseous metastases. Fluoride PET/CT has greater sensitivity
than standard bone scintigraphy in the detection of bone metastases, with
77% to 94% sensitivity, 92% to 99% specificity, and 82% to 97% PPV.210
However, emerging evidence indicates that other tracers such as PSMA
are at least equivalent to fluoride in the detection of osseous metastases
with the added advantage of soft tissue metastasis detection.211

The Panel believes that bone imaging can be achieved by conventional
technetium-99m-MDP bone scan. Plain films, CT, MRI, or PET/CT or
PET/MRI with F-18 sodium fluoride, C-11 choline, F-18 fluciclovine, Ga-68
PSMA-11, or F-18 piflufolastat PSMA can be considered for equivocal
results on initial bone imaging. Alternatively, Ga-68 PSMA-11 or F-18
piflufolastat PSMA PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered for bone and
soft tissue (full body) imaging. 212-215

Histologic or radiographic confirmation of involvement detected by PET
imaging is recommended whenever feasible due to the presence of false
positives. Although false positives exist, literature suggests that these are
outweighed by the increase in true positives detected by PET relative to
bone scintigraphy. To reduce the false-positive rate, physicians should
consider the intensity of PSMA-PET uptake and correlative CT findings in
the interpretation of scans. Several reporting systems have been proposed
but will not have been validated or widely used.216,217 Moreover, although
PET imaging may change treatment,207 it may not change oncologic
outcome. Earlier detection of bone metastatic disease, for instance, may
result in earlier use of newer and more expensive therapies, which may
not improve oncologic outcomes or OS.

Risks of Imaging

As with any medical procedure, imaging is not without risk. Some of these
risks are concrete and tangible, while others are less clear. Risks
associated with imaging include exposure to ionizing radiation, adverse
reaction to contrast media, false-positive scans, and overdetection.

Exposure to Ionizing Radiation
Deterministic and stochastic are two types of effects from exposure to
ionizing radiation by x-ray, CT, or PET/CT. Deterministic effects are those
that occur at a certain dose level, and include events such as cataracts
and radiation burns. No effect is seen below the dose threshold. Medical
imaging is always performed almost below the threshold for deterministic
effects. Stochastic effects tend to occur late, increase in likelihood as dose
increases, and have no known lower “safe” limit. The major stochastic
effect of concern in medical imaging is radiation-induced malignancy.
Unfortunately, no direct measurements are available to determine risk of
cancer arising from one or more medical imaging events, so risks are
calculated using other models (such as from survivors of radiation
exposure). The literature is conflicting with regard to the precise risk of
secondary malignancies in patients undergoing medical imaging
procedures. There is a small but finite risk of developing secondary
malignancies as a result of medical imaging procedures, and the risk is
greatest in young patients. However, the absolute risk of fatal malignancy
arising from a medical imaging procedure is very low, and is difficult to
detect given the prevalence of cancer in the population and the multiple
factors that contribute to oncogenesis.218 Efforts should be made to
minimize dose from these procedures, which begin with judicious use of
imaging only when justified by the clinical situation. Harm may arise from
not imaging a patient, through disease non-detection, or from erroneous
staging.

Adverse Reaction to Contrast Media
Many imaging studies make use of contrast material delivered by oral,
intravenous, or rectal routes. The use of contrast material may improve
study performance, but reactions to contrast material may occur and they
should be used only when warranted. Some patients develop adverse
reactions to iodinated intravenous contrast material. Most reactions are
mild cutaneous reactions (eg, urticaria, pruritus) but occasionally severe
reactions can be life-threatening (bronchospasm or anaphylaxis). The risk
of severe reaction is low with non-ionic contrast materials.219 Both
iodinated CT contrast material and gadolinium-based MR contrast
materials can be problematic in patients with reduced renal function.
Gadolinium MR contrast media, in particular, is contraindicated in patients
with acute renal failure or stage V chronic kidney disease (glomerular
filtration rate [GFR] <15).220 Patients in this category are significantly more
likely to develop nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Centers performing
imaging studies with contrast materials should have policies in place to
address the use of contrast in these patients.

False-Positive Scans and Overdetection
Every imaging test has limitations for sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy
that involve both the nature of the imaging modality as well as the
interpreting physician. Harm can arise when a tumor or tumor recurrence
is not detected (ie, false negative), but harm to the patient and added
expense to the medical system also can result from false-positive scans.
Extensive workup of imaging findings that may otherwise be benign or
indolent (ie, overdetection) can lead to significant patient anxiety,
additional and unnecessary imaging, and invasive procedures that carry
their own risks for adverse outcomes.

Accurate and medically relevant interpretation of imaging studies requires
familiarity and expertise in the imaging modality, attention to detail in
image review, knowledge of tumor biology, and familiarity with treatment

options and algorithms. Challenging cases are best addressed through
direct communication, either physician-to-physician or in a multidisciplinary
tumor board setting.

Medical imaging is a critical tool in the evaluation and comprehensive care
of patients with malignancy. However, as with any medical procedure,
imaging is not without risks to patients. Inappropriate use of imaging also
has been identified as a significant contributor to health care costs in the
United States and worldwide. Therefore, imaging should be performed
only when medically appropriate, and in a manner that reduces risk (eg,
minimizing radiation dose). An algorithmic approach to the use of imaging,
such as by NCCN and the Appropriateness Criteria developed by the
American College of Radiology,221 can assist in medical decision-making.

Observation

Observation involves monitoring the course of prostate cancer with a
history and physical exam no more often than every 12 months (without
surveillance biopsies) until symptoms develop or are thought to be
imminent. If patients under observation become symptomatic, an
assessment of disease burden can be performed, and treatment or
palliation can be considered. Observation thus differs from active
surveillance. The goal of observation is to maintain quality of life (QOL) by
avoiding noncurative treatment when prostate cancer is unlikely to cause
mortality or significant morbidity. The main advantage of observation is
avoidance of possible side effects of unnecessary definitive therapy or
ADT. However, patients may develop urinary retention or pathologic
fracture without prior symptoms or increasing PSA level.

Observation is applicable to patients who are older or frail with comorbidity
that will likely out-compete prostate cancer for cause of death. Johansson
and colleagues222 observed that only 13% of patients developed
metastases 15 years after diagnosis of T0–T2 disease and only 11% had

died from prostate cancer. Because prostate cancer will not be treated for
cure for patients with shorter life expectancies, observation for as long as
possible is a reasonable option based on physician discretion. Monitoring
should include PSA and physical exam no more often than every 6
months, but will not involve surveillance biopsies or radiographic imaging.
When symptoms develop or are imminent, patients can begin palliative
ADT.

Active Surveillance

Active surveillance (formerly referred to as watchful waiting, expectant
management, or deferred treatment) involves actively monitoring the
course of the disease with the expectation to deliver curative therapy if the
cancer progresses. Unlike observation, active surveillance is mainly
applicable to younger patients with seemingly indolent cancer with the
goal to defer or avoid treatment and its potential side effects. Because
these patients have a longer life expectancy, they should be followed
closely and treatment should start promptly should the cancer progress so
as not to miss the chance for cure.

Several large active surveillance cohort studies have shown that between
50% and 68% of those eligible for active surveillance may safely avoid
treatment, and thus the possible associated side effects of treatment, for
at least 10 years.223-225 For example, in one study, 55% of the population
remained untreated at 15 years.224 Although a proportion of patients on
active surveillance will eventually undergo treatment, the delay does not
appear to impact cure rates, and numerous studies have shown that active
surveillance can be a safe option for many patients.223-233 In fact, a 2015
meta-analysis of 26 active surveillance cohort studies that included 7627
patients identified only 8 prostate cancer deaths and 5 cases of
metastasis.234

Further, the ProtecT study, which randomized 1643 patients with localized
prostate cancer to active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, or RT, found
no significant difference in the primary outcome of prostate cancer
mortality at a median of 10 years follow-up.235 Of 17 prostate cancer
deaths (1% of study participants), 8 were in the active surveillance group,
5 were in the operation group, and 4 were in the radiation group (P = .48
for the overall comparison). However, a 12.2% absolute increase in the
rate of disease progression and a 3.4% absolute increase in the rate of
metastases or prostate cancer death were seen in the active surveillance
group.235,236 Approximately 23% of participants had Gleason scores 7–10,
and 5 of 8 deaths in the active surveillance group were in this subset.
Patient-reported outcomes were compared among the 3 groups.237 The
operation group experienced the greatest negative effect on sexual
function and urinary continence, whereas bowel function was worst in the
radiation group.

treatment, and patient preference. Shared decision-making, after
appropriate counseling on the risks and benefits of the various options, is
critical.

The panel believes there is an urgent need for further clinical research
regarding the criteria for recommending active surveillance, the criteria for
reclassification on active surveillance, and the schedule for active
surveillance especially as it pertains to prostate biopsies, which pose an
increasing burden. One important ongoing study that can help answer
these questions is the prospective multi-institutional Canary PASS cohort
study, which has been funded by the NCI.230 Nine hundred five patients,
median age 63 years and median follow-up 28 months, demonstrated 19%
conversion to therapy. Much should be learned about the criteria for
selection of and progression on active surveillance as this cohort and
research effort mature.

In addition, studies have shown that active surveillance does not adversely
impact psychological well-being or QOL.237-242

The proportion of patients with low-risk prostate cancer choosing active
surveillance in the Veterans Affairs Integrated Health Care System
increased from 2005 to 2015: from 4% to 39% of those <65 years and
from 3% to 41% of those ≥65 years.243 An analysis of the SEER database
found a similar trend, with the use of active surveillance in patients with
low-risk prostate cancer increasing from 14.5% in 2010 to 42.1% in
2015.244 An international, hospital-based, retrospective analysis of greater
than 115,000 patients with low-risk prostate cancer reported that active
surveillance utilization increased, but the proportions were lower at 7% in
2010 and 20% in 2014.245

Ultimately, a recommendation for active surveillance must be based on
careful individualized weighing of a number of factors: life expectancy,
general health condition, disease characteristics, potential side effects of

Rationale

The NCCN Guidelines Panel remains concerned about the problems of
overtreatment related to the increased frequency of diagnosis of prostate
cancer from widespread use of PSA for early detection or screening (see
the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection, available at
www.NCCN.org).

The debate about the need to diagnose and treat every individual who has
prostate cancer is fueled by the high prevalence of prostate cancer upon
autopsy of the prostate246; the high frequency of positive prostate biopsies
in individuals with normal DREs and serum PSA values247; the contrast
between the incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer; and the
need to treat an estimated 37 patients with screen-detected prostate
cancer248,249 or 100 patients with low-risk prostate cancer250 to prevent one
death from the disease. The controversy regarding overtreatment of
prostate cancer and the value of prostate cancer early detection248-254 has

Prostate Cancer

been further informed by publication of the Goteborg study, a subset of the
European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer
(ERSPC).255,256 Many believe that this study best approximates proper use
of PSA for early detection because it was population-based and involved a
1:1 randomization of 20,000 participants who received PSA every 2 years
and used thresholds for prostate biopsy of PSA >3 and >2.5 since 2005.
The 14-year follow-up reported in 2010 was longer than the European
study as a whole (9 years) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and
Ovarian (PLCO) trial (11.5 years). Prostate cancer was diagnosed in
12.7% of the screened group compared to 8.2% of the control group.
Prostate cancer mortality was 0.5% in the screened group and 0.9% in the
control group, which gave a 40% absolute cumulative risk reduction of
prostate cancer death (compared to ERSPC 20% and PLCO 0%).255 Most
impressively, 40% of the patients were initially on active surveillance and
28% were still on active surveillance at the time these results were
analyzed. To prevent a prostate cancer death, 12 individuals would need
to be diagnosed and treated as opposed to the ERSPC as a whole where
37 individuals needed to be treated. Analysis of 18-year follow-up data
from the Goteborg study reduced the number needed to be diagnosed to
prevent 1 prostate cancer death to 10.257 Thus, early detection, when
applied properly, should reduce prostate cancer mortality. However, that
reduction comes at the expense of overtreatment that may occur in as
many as 50% of patients treated for PSA-detected prostate cancer.258

The best models of prostate cancer detection and progression estimate
that 23% to 42% of all U.S. screen-detected cancers were overtreated259
and that PSA detection was responsible for up to 12.3 years of lead-time
bias.260 The NCCN Guidelines Panel responded to these evolving data
with careful consideration of which patients should be recommended
active surveillance. However, the NCCN Guidelines Panel recognizes the
uncertainty associated with the estimation of chance of competing causes
of death; the definition of very-low-, low-, and favorable intermediate-risk

prostate cancer; the ability to detect disease progression without
compromising chance of cure; and the chance and consequences of
treatment side effects.

Patient Selection

Epstein and colleagues261 introduced clinical criteria to predict
pathologically “insignificant” prostate cancer. Insignificant, or very-low-risk,
prostate cancer is identified by: clinical stage T1c, biopsy Grade Group 1,
the presence of disease in fewer than 3 biopsy cores, ≤50% prostate
cancer involvement in any core, and PSA density <0.15 ng/mL/g. Despite
the usefulness of these criteria, physicians are cautioned against using
these as the sole decision maker. Studies have shown that as many as
8% of cancers that qualified as insignificant using the Epstein criteria were
not organ-confined based on postoperative findings.262,263 A new
nomogram may be better.264 Although many variations upon this definition
have been proposed (reviewed by Bastian and colleagues265), a
consensus of the NCCN Guidelines Panel was reached that insignificant
prostate cancer, especially when detected early using serum PSA, poses
little threat to individuals with a life expectancy of less than 20 years. The
confidence that Americans with very-low-risk prostate cancer have a very
small risk of prostate cancer death is enhanced by lead time bias
introduced by PSA early detection that ranges from an estimated 12.3
years in a 55-year-old individual to 6 years in a 75-year-old individual.260

At this time, the NCCN Panel consensus is that active surveillance is
preferred for all patients with very-low-risk prostate cancer and life
expectancy greater than 10 years.

Active Surveillance in Low-Risk Disease
Panel consensus is that active surveillance is preferred for most patients
with low-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy greater than or equal to
10 years. However, the panel recognizes that there is heterogeneity

across the low-risk group, and that some factors may be associated with
an increased probability of near-term grade reclassification including high
PSA density, a high number of positive cores (eg, ≥3), high genomic risk
(from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis), and/or a known BRCA2
germline mutation.266-268 Of note, core involvement in the major active
surveillance cohort studies was generally low (see Table 1 in the
Principles of Active Surveillance and Observation, in the algorithm above).
Therefore, in some of patients with low-risk prostate cancer, upfront
treatment with radical prostatectomy or prostate RT may be preferred
based on shared decision-making with the patient.

Active Surveillance in Favorable Intermediate-Risk Disease
The literature on outcomes of active surveillance in patients with
intermediate-risk prostate cancer is limited.269 In the PIVOT trial, patients
with clinically localized prostate cancer and a life expectancy greater than
or equal to 10 years were randomized to radical prostatectomy or
observation.270 Of the 120 participants with intermediate-risk disease who
were randomized to observation, 13 died from prostate cancer, a non-
significant difference compared with 6 prostate cancer deaths in 129
participants with intermediate-risk disease in the radical prostatectomy
arm (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.21–1.21; P = .12). After longer follow-up
(median 12.7 years), a small difference was seen in all-cause mortality in
those with intermediate-risk disease (absolute difference, 14.5 percentage
points; 95% CI, 2.8–25.6), but not in those with low-risk disease (absolute
difference, 0.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -10.5–11.8).271 Urinary
incontinence and erectile and sexual dysfunction, however, were worse
through 10 years in the radical prostatectomy group. These results and the
less-than-average health of participants in the PIVOT study272 suggest that
patients with competing risks may safely be offered active surveillance.

Other prospective studies of active surveillance that included patients with
intermediate-risk prostate cancer resulted in favorable prostate cancer-

specific survival rates of 94% to 100% for the full cohorts.224,227,228
However, with extended follow-up, the Toronto group has demonstrated
inferior metastasis-free survival for patients with intermediate-risk prostate
cancer (15-year metastasis-free survival for cases of Gleason 6 or less
with PSA <10 ng/mL, 94%; Gleason 6 or less with PSA 10–20 ng/mL,
94%; Gleason 3+4 with PSA 20 ng/mL or less, 84%; and Gleason 4+3
with PSA 20 ng/mL or less, 63%).273

Overall, the Panel interpreted these data to show that a subset of patients
with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer and life expectancy
greater than 10 years may be considered for active surveillance. However,
the precise inclusion criteria and follow-up protocols need continued
refinement. Patients must understand that a significant proportion of those
clinically staged as having favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer may
have higher risk disease.274-277 Particular consideration to active
surveillance may be appropriate for those patients with a low percentage
of Gleason pattern 4 cancer, low tumor volume, low PSA density, and/or
low genomic risk (from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis), but should
be approached with caution, include informed decision-making, and use
close monitoring for progression.

Role of Race in Decisions Regarding Active Surveillance
Race is emerging as an important factor to consider when contemplating
active surveillance, particularly for African-American patients. A CDC
analysis of population-based cancer registries found that from 2003 to
2017, the incidence of prostate cancer was higher in black individuals than
in white individuals, Hispanic individuals, American Indian/Alaska natives,
and Asian/Pacific islanders.278 Five-year survival for all stages combined
was higher for white patients than for black or Hispanic patients, but
survival for distant stage disease was higher for black patients than white
patients. In an analysis that spanned 2010 to 2012, African Americans had
a higher lifetime risk of developing (18.2% vs. 13.3%) and dying from

Prostate Cancer

(4.4% vs. 2.4%) prostate cancer compared to Caucasian Americans.279 In
one study, the increase in prostate-cancer-specific mortality in African
American patients was limited to those with grade group 1.280 Multiple
studies have shown that African Americans with very-low-risk prostate
cancer may harbor high-grade (Grade Group ≥2) cancer that is not
detected by pre-treatment biopsies. Compared to Caucasian Americans
matched on clinical parameters, African Americans have been reported to
have a 1.7- to 2.3-fold higher change of pathologic upgrading.281,282
However, other studies have not seen different rates of upstaging or
upgrading.283,284 For example, in a retrospective study of 895 patients in the
SEARCH database, no significant differences were seen in the rates of
pathologic upgrading, upstaging, or biochemical recurrence between
African American and Caucasian Americans.283

Several studies have reported that, among patients with low-risk prostate
cancer who are enrolled in active surveillance programs, African
Americans have higher risk of disease progression to higher Gleason
grade or volume cancer than Caucasian Americans.285-288 African
Americans in the low- to intermediate-risk categories also appear to suffer
from an increased risk of biochemical recurrence after treatment.289 In
addition, African American patients with low-risk or favorable intermediate-
risk prostate cancer have an increase in all-cause mortality after
treatment, mainly due to cardiovascular complications after ADT.290

Reasons for these clinical disparities are under investigation, but treatment
disparities and access to health care may play a significant role.291,292 In
fact, results of some studies suggest that racial disparities in prostate
cancer outcomes are minimized when health care access is equal.293-296
Strategies to improve risk-stratification for African Americans considering
active surveillance may include mpMRI in concert with targeted image-
guided biopsies, which have been reported to improve detection of
clinically significant tumors in some individuals.297

Confirmatory Testing

Confirmatory testing can help facilitate early identification of those patients
who may be at a higher risk of future grade reclassification or cancer
progression. Since an initial prostate biopsy may underestimate tumor
grade or volume, confirmatory testing is strongly recommended within the
first 6 to 12 months of diagnosis for patients who are considering active
surveillance.

Before starting on an active surveillance program, mpMRI with calculation
of PSA density should be considered to confirm candidacy for active
surveillance if not performed during initial workup.298 Patients with PI-
RADS 4 or 5 on mpMRI have an increased risk of biopsy progression
during active surveillance.299

In patients with low and favorable intermediate risk, molecular tumor
analysis can also be considered before deciding whether to pursue active
surveillance (see Tumor Multigene Molecular Testing, above). One study
examined the role of molecular tumor analysis for predicting upgrading on
surveillance biopsy or the presence of adverse pathology on eventual
radical prostatectomy in patients in an active surveillance cohort.156 In this
study, results of the molecular testing did not significantly improve risk
stratification over the use of clinical variables alone.

If results of mpMRI and/or molecular testing are concerning, a repeat
biopsy may be appropriate.

Early confirmatory testing may not be necessary in patients who have had
a complete workup including mpMRI prior to diagnostic biopsy, advanced
PSA-based bloodwork, and/or molecular tumor analysis. However, all
patients should undergo a confirmatory prostate biopsy within 1 to 2 years
of their diagnostic biopsy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Active Surveillance Program

The current NCCN recommendations for the active surveillance program
include PSA no more often than every 6 months unless clinically indicated;
DRE no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated;
repeat prostate biopsy no more often than every 12 months unless
clinically indicated; and repeat mpMRI no more often than every 12
months unless clinically indicated. Repeat molecular tumor analysis is
discouraged during active surveillance. Results of a study of 211 patients
with Grade Group 1 prostate cancer who had initial and repeat mpMRIs
and PSA monitoring suggest that a negative initial mpMRI predicts a low
risk of Gleason upgrading by systematic biopsy.300 In addition, PSA
velocity was significantly associated with subsequent progression in those
with an initial negative mpMRI. In contrast, those with high-risk visible
lesions on mpMRI before initiation of active surveillance had an increased
risk of progression. A meta-analysis of 43 studies found the sensitivity and
NPV for mpMRI to be 0.81 and 0.78, respectively.301 An analysis of
patients in Canary PASS found that mpMRI had an NPV and PPV for
detecting Grade Group ≥2 cancer of 83% and 31%, respectively.302
Another study found the NPV of mpMRI to be 80%.303

Whereas the intensity of surveillance may be tailored on an individual
basis (eg, based on life expectancy and risk of reclassification), most
patients should have prostate biopsies incorporated as part of their
monitoring, but no more often than every 12 months, because PSA
kinetics may not be reliable for predicting progression. Repeat biopsy is
useful to determine whether higher Gleason grade exists, which may
influence prognosis and hence the decision to continue active surveillance
or proceed to definitive local therapy.304 A repeat prostate biopsy should
also be considered if the prostate exam changes, if mpMRI (if done)
suggests more aggressive disease, or if PSA increases. However,
literature suggests that as many as 7% of patients undergoing prostate
biopsy will suffer an adverse event,252 and those who develop urinary tract

infection are often fluoroquinolone-resistant.305 Radical prostatectomy may
become technically challenging after multiple sets of biopsies, especially
as it pertains to potency preservation.306 Therefore, many clinicians choose
to wait 2 years for a biopsy if there are no signs of progression.

If the PSA level increases and systematic prostate biopsy remains
negative, mpMRI may be considered to exclude the presence of anterior
cancer.307

In patients with a suspicious lesion on mpMRI, MRI-US fusion biopsy
improves the detection of higher grade (Grade Group ≥2) cancers. Early
experience supports the utilization of mpMRI in biopsy protocols to better
risk stratify patients under active surveillance.308-310 However, more recent
studies have shown that a significant proportion of high-grade cancers are
detected with systematic biopsy and not targeted biopsy in patients on
active surveillance.311-313

Patients should be transitioned to observation (see Observation, above)
when life expectancy is less than 10 years.

Considerations for Treatment of Patients on Active Surveillance

Reliable parameters of prostate cancer progression await the results of
ongoing clinical trials. PSADT is not considered reliable enough to be used
alone to detect disease progression.314 If repeat biopsy shows Grade
Group ≥3 disease, or if tumor is found in a greater number of biopsy cores
or in a higher percentage of a given biopsy core, cancer progression may
have occurred. Grade reclassification on repeat biopsy is the most
common factor influencing a change in management from active
surveillance to treatment. Other factors affecting decisions to actively treat
include: increase in tumor volume, a rise in PSA density, as well as patient
anxiety. Considerations for a change in management strategy should be
made in the context of the patient’s life expectancy.

Prostate Cancer

Each of the major active surveillance series has used different criteria for
reclassification.223,224,229-232,315-318 Reclassification criteria were met by 23%
of patients with a median follow-up of 7 years in the Toronto experience,316
36% of patients with a median follow-up of 5 years in the Johns Hopkins
experience,223 and 16% of patients with a median follow-up of 3.5 years in
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) experience232 (Table 3).
Uncertainty regarding reclassification criteria and the desire to avoid
missing an opportunity for cure drove several reports that dealt with the
validity of commonly used reclassification criteria. The Toronto group
demonstrated that a PSA trigger point of PSADT less than 3 years could
not be improved upon by using a PSA threshold of 10 or 20, PSADT
calculated in various ways, or PSA velocity greater than 2 ng/mL/y.319 The
Johns Hopkins group used biopsy-demonstrated reclassification to
Gleason pattern 4 or 5 or increased tumor volume on biopsy as their
criteria for reclassification. Of 290 patients on an annual prostate biopsy
program, 35% demonstrated reclassification at a median follow-up of 2.9
years.320 Neither PSADT (area under the curve [AUC], 0.59) nor PSA
velocity (AUC, 0.61) was associated with prostate biopsy reclassification.
Both groups have concluded that PSA kinetics cannot replace regular
prostate biopsy, although treatment of most patients who demonstrate
reclassification on prostate biopsy prevents evaluation of biopsy
reclassification as a criterion for treatment or reduction of survival.
Treatment of all patients who developed Gleason pattern 4 on annual
prostate biopsies has thus far resulted in only 2 prostate cancer deaths
among 1298 patients (0.15%) in the Johns Hopkins study.223 However, it
remains uncertain whether treatment of all who progressed to Gleason
pattern 4 was necessary. Studies remain in progress to identify the best
trigger points when interventions with curative intent may still be
successful.

The Toronto group published findings on three patients who died of
prostate cancer in their experience with 450 patients on active

surveillance.316 These three deaths led them to revise their criteria for
offering active surveillance, because each of these three patients probably
had metastatic disease at the time of entry on active surveillance. The 450
patients were followed for a median of 6.8 years; OS was 78.6% and
prostate cancer-specific survival was 97.2%.316 Of the 30% (n = 145) of
patients who progressed, 8% had an increase in Gleason grade, 14% had
a PSADT less than 3 years, 1% developed a prostate nodule, and 3%
were treated because of anxiety. One hundred thirty-five of these 145
patients were treated: 35 by radical prostatectomy, 90 by EBRT with or
without ADT, and 10 with ADT alone. Follow-up is available for 110 of
these patients, and 5-year biochemical PFS is 62% for those undergoing
radical prostatectomy and 43% for those undergoing radiation. Longer-
term follow-up of this cohort was reported in 2015.224 The 10- and 15-year
actuarial cause-specific survival rates for the entire cohort were 98.1% and
94.3%, respectively. Only 15 of 993 (1.5%) patients had died of prostate
cancer, an additional 13 patients (1.3%) had developed metastatic
disease, and only 36.5% of the cohort had received treatment by 10 years.
In an analysis of 592 patients enrolled in this cohort who had 1 or more
repeat prostate biopsies, 31.3% of cases were upgraded. Fifteen percent
of upgraded cases were upgraded to Gleason ≥8, and 62% of total
upgraded cases proceeded to active treatment.321 Another analysis of this
cohort revealed that metastatic disease developed in 13 of 133 patients
with Gleason 7 disease (9.8%) and 17 of 847 patients with Gleason ≤6
disease (2.0%).322 PSADT and the number of positive scores were also
predictors of increased risk for the development of metastatic disease.

In comparison, among 192 patients on active surveillance who underwent
delayed treatment at a median of 2 years after diagnosis in the Johns
Hopkins experience, 5-year biochemical PFS was 96% for those who
underwent radical prostatectomy and 75% for those who underwent
radiation.318 The two groups were similar by pathologic Gleason grade,
pathologic stage, and margin positivity. All patients treated by radical

to 97% of those in the primary radical prostatectomy group at a median
follow-up of 35.5 months. A later publication from this group showed that
23 of 287 patients who were treated after active surveillance (8%)
experienced biochemical recurrence, and the rate was independent of the
type of treatment.223 Several studies have shown that delayed radical
prostatectomy does not increase the rates of adverse pathology.230,323-325

Radical Prostatectomy

Radical prostatectomy is appropriate for any patient whose cancer
appears clinically localized to the prostate. However, because of potential
perioperative morbidity, radical prostatectomy should generally be
reserved for patients whose life expectancy is 10 years or more.
Stephenson and colleagues121 reported a low 15-year prostate cancer-
specific mortality of 12% in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy
(5% for patients with low-risk disease), although it is unclear whether the
favorable prognosis is due to the effectiveness of the procedure or the low
lethality of cancers detected in the PSA era.

Radical prostatectomy was compared to watchful waiting in a randomized
trial of 695 patients with early-stage prostate cancer (mostly T2).326,327 With
a median follow-up of 12.8 years, those assigned to the radical
prostatectomy group had significant improvements in disease-specific
survival, OS, and risk of metastasis and local progression.326 The reduction
in mortality was confirmed at 18 years of follow-up, with an absolute
difference of 11%.327 Overall, 8 patients needed to be treated to avert one
death; that number fell to 4 for patients <65 years of age. Longer follow-up
results were also reported, in which the cumulative incidence of death
from prostate cancer was 19.6% and 31.3% in the radical prostatectomy
and watchful waiting groups, respectively, at 23 years, with a mean
increase of 2.9 years of life in the radical prostatectomy group.328 The

results of this trial offer high-quality evidence to support radical
prostatectomy as a treatment option for clinically localized prostate cancer.

Some patients at high or very high risk may benefit from radical
prostatectomy. In an analysis of 842 patients with Gleason scores 8 to 10
at biopsy who underwent radical prostatectomy, predictors of unfavorable
outcome included PSA level over 10 ng/mL, clinical stage T2b or higher,
Gleason score 9 or 10, higher number of biopsy cores with high-grade
cancer, and over 50% core involvement.329 Patients without these
characteristics showed higher 10-year biochemical-free and disease-
specific survival after radical prostatectomy compared to those with
unfavorable findings (31% vs. 4% and 75% vs. 52%, respectively). Radical
prostatectomy is an option for patients with high-risk disease and in select
patients with very-high-risk disease.

Retrospective data and population-based studies suggest that radical
prostatectomy with PLND can be an effective option for patients with cN1
disease.330-332 Extrapolation of results of STAMPEDE arm H, in which
EBRT to the primary tumor improved OS and other endpoints in patients
with low-volume metastatic disease, also suggests that local treatment to
the prostate may be beneficial in patients with advanced disease.333

Radical prostatectomy is a treatment option for patients experiencing
biochemical recurrence after primary EBRT, but morbidity (incontinence,
erectile dysfunction, and bladder neck contracture) remains significantly
higher than when radical prostatectomy is used as initial therapy.334,335
Overall and cancer-specific 10-year survival ranged from 54% to 89% and
70% to 83%, respectively.334 Patient selection is important, and post-RT
recurrence radical prostatectomy should only be performed by highly
experienced surgeons.

Prostate Cancer

Operative Techniques and Adverse Effects

Long-term cancer control has been achieved in most patients with both the
retropubic and the perineal approaches to radical prostatectomy; high-
volume surgeons in high-volume centers generally achieve superior
outcomes.336,337 Laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy are
commonly used and are considered comparable to conventional
approaches in experienced hands.338-340 In a cohort study using SEER
Medicare-linked data on 8837 patients, minimally invasive compared to
open radical prostatectomy was associated with shorter length of hospital
stay, less need for blood transfusions, and fewer surgical complications,
but rates of incontinence and erectile dysfunction were higher.341 A second
large study reported no difference in overall complications, readmission,
and additional cancer therapies between open and robot-assisted radical
prostatectomy, although the robotic approach was associated with higher
rates of genitourinary complications and lower rates of blood
transfusion.342 Oncologic outcome of a robotic versus open approach was
similar when assessed by use of additional therapies341 or rate of positive
surgical margins,343 although longer follow-up is necessary. A meta-
analysis on 19 observational studies (n = 3893) reported less blood loss
and lower transfusion rates with minimally invasive techniques than with
open operation.343 Risk of positive surgical margins was the same. Two
more recent meta-analyses showed a statistically significant advantage in
favor of a robotic approach compared to an open approach in 12-month
urinary continence344 and potency recovery.345 Early results from a
randomized controlled phase 3 study comparing robot-assisted
laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and open radical retropubic
prostatectomy in 326 patients were published in 2016.346,347 Urinary
function and sexual function scores and rates of postoperative
complications did not differ significantly between the groups at 6, 12, and
24 months after surgery. Rates of positive surgical margins were similar,
based on a superiority test (10% in the open group vs. 15% in the robotic
group). Assessment of oncologic outcomes from this trial will be limited

because postoperative management and additional cancer therapies were
not standardized between the groups.346

An analysis of the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study on 1655 patients with
localized prostate cancer compared long-term functional outcomes after
radical prostatectomy or EBRT.348 At 2 and 5 years, patients who
underwent radical prostatectomy reported higher rates of urinary
incontinence and erectile dysfunction but lower rates of bowel urgency.
However, no significant difference was observed at 15 years. In a large
retrospective cohort study involving 32,465 patients, those who received
EBRT had a lower 5-year incidence of urologic procedures than those who
underwent radical prostatectomy, but higher incidence for hospital
admissions, rectal or anal procedures, open surgical procedures, and
secondary malignancies.349

Return of urinary continence after radical prostatectomy may be improved
by preserving the urethra beyond the prostatic apex and by avoiding
damage to the distal sphincter mechanism. Bladder neck preservation
may allow more rapid recovery of urinary control.350 Anastomotic strictures
that increase the risk of long-term incontinence are less frequent with
modern surgical techniques. Recovery of erectile function is related
directly to the degree of preservation of the cavernous nerves, age at
surgery, and preoperative erectile function. Improvement in urinary and
sexual function has been reported with nerve-sparing techniques.351,352
Replacement of resected nerves with nerve grafts does not appear to be
effective for patients undergoing wide resection of the neurovascular
bundles.353 The ability of mpMRI to detect extracapsular extension can aid
in decision-making in nerve-sparing surgery.171

Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection

The decision to perform PLND should be guided by the probability of nodal
metastases. The NCCN Guidelines Panel chose 2% as the cutoff for

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

PLND because this avoids 47.7% of PLNDs at a cost of missing 12.1% of
positive pelvic lymph nodes.126 A more recent analysis of 26,713 patients
in the SEER database treated with radical prostatectomy and PLND
between 2010 and 2013 found that the 2% nomogram threshold would
avoid 22.3% of PLNDs at a cost of missing 3.0% of positive pelvic lymph
nodes.354 The Panel recommends use of a nomogram developed at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center that uses pretreatment PSA,
clinical stage, and Gleason sum to predict the risk of pelvic lymph node
metastases.126

PLND should be performed using an extended technique.355,356 An
extended PLND includes removal of all node-bearing tissue from an area
bounded by the external iliac vein anteriorly, the pelvic side wall laterally,
the bladder wall medially, the floor of the pelvis posteriorly, Cooper’s
ligament distally, and the internal iliac artery proximally. Removal of more
lymph nodes using the extended technique has been associated with
increased likelihood of finding lymph node metastases, thereby providing
more complete staging.357-359 A survival advantage with more extensive
lymphadenectomy has been suggested by several studies, possibly due to
elimination of microscopic metastases,358,360-362 although definitive proof of
oncologic benefit is lacking.363 PLND can be performed safely
laparoscopically, robotically, or as an open procedure, and complication
rates should be similar among the three approaches.

Radiation Therapy

RT techniques used in prostate cancer include EBRT, proton radiation,
and brachytherapy. EBRT techniques include IMRT and hypofractionated,
image-guided SBRT. An analysis that included propensity-score matching
of patients showed that, among younger patients with prostate cancer,
stereotactic body RT (SBRT) and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) had
similar toxicity profiles whereas proton radiation was associated with
reduced urinary toxicity and increased bowel toxicity. The cost of proton

therapy was almost double that of IMRT, and SBRT was slightly less
expensive.364

The panel believes that highly conformal RT (CRT) techniques should be
used to treat localized prostate cancer. Photon and proton beam radiation
are both effective at achieving highly CRT with acceptable and similar
biochemical control and long-term side effect profiles. Radiation
techniques are discussed in more detail below.

External Beam Radiation Therapy

Over the past several decades, EBRT techniques have evolved to allow
higher doses of radiation to be administered safely. Three-dimensional
(3D) CRT (3D-CRT) uses computer software to integrate CT images of the
patients’ internal anatomy in the treatment position, which allows higher
cumulative doses to be delivered with lower risk of late effects.137,365-367 The
second-generation 3D technique, IMRT, has been used increasingly in
practice.368 IMRT reduced the risk of gastrointestinal toxicities and rates of
post-recurrence therapy compared to 3D-CRT in some but not all older
retrospective and population-based studies, although treatment cost is
increased.369-372

More recently, moderately hypofractionated image-guided IMRT regimens
(2.4–4 Gy per fraction over 4–6 weeks) have been tested in randomized
trials, and their efficacy has been similar or non-inferior to conventionally
fractionated IMRT, with one trial showing fewer treatment failures with a
moderately fractionated regimen.373-382 Toxicity was similar between
moderately hypofractionated and conventional regimens in some373,377,380,381
but not all of the trials.375,378,379 In addition, efficacy results varied among the
trials, with some showing noninferiority or similar efficacy and others
showing that hypofractionation may be less effective than conventional
fractionation schemes. These safety and efficacy differences are likely a
result of differences in fractionation schedules.383 In addition, results of a

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

large cohort study showed no differences in QOL or urinary or bowel
function between those that received hypofractionated versus
conventional regimens.384 Overall, the panel believes that hypofractionated
IMRT techniques, which are more convenient for patients, can be
considered as an alternative to conventionally fractionated regimens when
clinically indicated. The panel lists fractionation schemes that have shown
acceptable efficacy and toxicity on PROS-F page 3 of 5 in the algorithm
above. An ASTRO/ASCO/AUA evidence-based guideline regarding the
use of hypofractionated radiation in patients with localized prostate cancer
concluded that moderately fractionated regimens are justified for routine
use in this setting and provides more detail on the topic.385

Daily prostate localization using image-guided RT (IGRT) is essential with
either 3D-CRT or IMRT for target margin reduction and treatment
accuracy. Imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, implanted fiducials,
electromagnetic targeting and tracking, or endorectal balloon, can improve
cure rates and decrease complications.

These techniques have permitted safer dose escalation, and results of
randomized trials have suggested that dose escalation is associated with
improved biochemical outcomes.386-391 Kuban and colleagues389 published
an analysis of their dose-escalation trial of 301 patients with stage T1b to
T3 prostate cancer. Freedom from biochemical or clinical recurrence was
higher in the group randomized to 78 Gy compared to 70 Gy (78% vs.
59%, P = .004) at a median follow-up of 8.7 years. The difference was
even greater among patients with diagnostic PSA >10 ng/mL (78% vs.
39%, P = .001). A longer follow-up (mean 14.3 years) found that
improvements in biochemical and clinical recurrences were sustained, with
lower rates of additional cancer treatment and better prostate cancer-
specific mortality.392 OS was not improved.

An analysis of the National Cancer Database found that dose escalation
(75.6–90 Gy) resulted in a dose-dependent improvement in OS for

patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer.393 In light of these
findings, the conventional 70 Gy dose is no longer considered adequate. A
dose of 75.6 to 79.2 Gy in conventional fractions to the prostate (with or
without seminal vesicles) is appropriate for patients with low-risk cancers.
Patients Intermediate-risk and high-risk disease should receive doses of
up to 81.0 Gy.369,394,395

Data suggested that EBRT and radical prostatectomy were effective for
the treatment of localized prostate cancer.396 EBRT of the primary prostate
cancer shows several distinct advantages over radical prostatectomy.
EBRT avoids complications associated with operation, such as bleeding
and transfusion-related effects, and risks associated with anesthesia, such
as myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolus. 3D-CRT and IMRT
techniques are widely available and are possible for patients over a wide
range of ages. EBRT has a low risk of urinary incontinence and stricture
and a good chance of short-term preservation of erectile function.397

The disadvantages of EBRT include a treatment course of 8 to 9 weeks.
Up to 50% of patients have some temporary bladder or bowel symptoms
during treatment. There is a low but definite risk of protracted rectal
symptoms from radiation proctitis, and the risk of erectile dysfunction
increases over time.397,398 The risk of late rectal complications following RT
is related to the volume of the rectum receiving doses of radiation close to
or exceeding the radiation dose required to control the primary tumor.

Biomaterials have been developed, tested, and FDA approved to serve as
spacer materials when inserted between the rectum and prostate.399,400 In a
randomized phase 3 multicenter clinical trial of patients undergoing image-
guided IMRT (IG-IMRT), where the risk of late (3-year) common
terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) was grade 2 or higher,
physician-recorded rectal complications declined from 5.7% to 0% in the
control versus hydrogel spacer group.401 The hydrogel spacer group had a
significant reduction in bowel QOL decline. No significant differences in

Prostate Cancer

adverse events were noted in those receiving hydrogel placement versus
controls. Results of a secondary analysis of this trial suggest that use of a
perirectal spacer may decrease the sexual side effects of radiation.402
Spacer implantation, however, is quite expensive and may be associated
with rare complications such as rectum perforation and urethral
damage.403,404 Retrospective data also support its use in similar patients
undergoing brachytherapy. Overall, the panel believes that biocompatible
and biodegradable perirectal spacer materials may be implanted between
the prostate and rectum in patients undergoing external radiotherapy with
organ-confined prostate cancer in order to displace the rectum from high
radiation dose regions. Patients with obvious rectal invasion or visible T3
and posterior extension should not undergo perirectal spacer implantation.

If the cancer recurs, radical prostatectomy after RT is associated with a
higher risk of complications than primary radical prostatectomy.405
Contraindications to EBRT include prior pelvic irradiation, active
inflammatory disease of the rectum, or a permanent indwelling Foley
catheter. Relative contraindications include very low bladder capacity,
chronic moderate or severe diarrhea, bladder outlet obstruction requiring a
suprapubic catheter, and inactive ulcerative colitis.

EBRT for Early Disease
EBRT is one of the principal treatment options for clinically localized
prostate cancer. The NCCN Guidelines Panel consensus was that modern
EBRT and surgical series show similar PFS in patients with low-risk
disease treated with radical prostatectomy or EBRT. In a study of 3546
patients treated with brachytherapy plus EBRT, disease-free survival
(DFS) remained steady at 73% between 15 and 25 years of follow-up.406
The panel lists several acceptable dosing schemas in the guidelines. The
NRG Oncology/RTOG 0126 randomized clinical trial compared 79.2 Gy
(44 fractions) and 70.2 Gy (39 fractions), both in 1.8 Gy fractions, in 1499
patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.407 After a median follow-up

of 8.4 years, the escalated dose reduced biochemical recurrences, but
increased late toxicity and had no effect on OS.

EBRT for Patients with High-Risk or Very-High-Risk Disease
EBRT has demonstrated efficacy in patients with high-risk and very-high-
risk prostate cancer. One study randomized 415 patients to EBRT alone or
EBRT plus 3-year ADT.408 In another study (RTOG 8531), 977 patients
with T3 disease treated with EBRT were randomized to adjuvant ADT or
ADT at relapse.409 Two other randomized phase 3 trials evaluated long-
term ADT with or without radiation in a population of patients who mostly
had T3 disease.410-413 In all four studies, the combination group showed
improved disease-specific survival and OS compared to single-modality
treatment. Patients with a PSA nadir >0.5 ng/mL after radiation and 6
months of ADT have an adjusted HR for all-cause mortality of 1.72 (95%
CI, 1.17–2.52; P = .01) compared with patients who received radiation
only.414

Prophylactic nodal radiation should be considered in this population. 415-417
The randomized controlled phase 3 POP-RT trial showed that pelvic
radiation can improve biochemical failure-free survival (FFS) and DFS
compared with prostate-only radiation in patients with high- and very-high-
risk prostate cancer.418 The randomized phase 3 FLAME trial showed that
a focal radiation boost to the mpMRI-visible lesion can improve
biochemical DFS in this population.419

Some earlier data suggested that the use of docetaxel in combination with
ADT and EBRT may benefit fit patients with high- and very-high-risk
localized disease. The GETUG 12 trial randomized 413 patients with high-
or very-high-risk prostate cancer to IMRT and ADT or ADT, docetaxel, and
estramustine.420 After a median follow-up of 8.8 years, 8-year relapse-free
survival was 62% in the combination therapy arm and 50% in the ADT-
only arm (adjusted HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54–0.94; P = .017). The
multicenter, phase 3 NRG Oncology RTOG 0521 trial randomized 563

patients with high- or very-high-risk prostate cancer ADT plus EBRT with
or without docetaxel.421 After a median follow-up of 5.7 years, 4-year OS
was 89% (95% CI, 84%–92%) for ADT/EBRT and 93% (95% CI, 90%–
96%) for ADT/EBRT/docetaxel (HR, 0.69; 90% CI, 0.49–0.97; one-sided P
= .03). Improvements were also seen in DFS and the rate of distant
metastasis. In the STAMPEDE trial, the addition of docetaxel to EBRT and
ADT improved FFS in the non-metastatic group (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45–
0.80; P < .01).422 OS analysis did not show a significant difference, but was
limited in power. Based on these data, the panel recommends the addition
of docetaxel added to EBRT and 2 years of ADT as an option for patients
with very-high-risk prostate cancer. The Panel recommends the addition of
docetaxel to ADT plus EBRT as an option for patients with very-high-risk
prostate cancer, but does not recommend it for patients with high-risk
prostate cancer at this time.

The Panel recommends the addition of abiraterone to ADT plus EBRT as
an option for patients with very-high-risk prostate cancer (fine-particle
abiraterone can also be used, category 2B). This recommendation is
based on data from the STAMPEDE trial. In STAMPEDE, the HRs for FFS
in patients with non-metastatic disease treated with EBRT/ADT plus
abiraterone compared with EBRT/ADT was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.15–0.31).423

A head-to-head comparison of ADT with either abiraterone or docetaxel in
this setting and in patients with metastatic disease showed no difference in
safety or in efficacy endpoints including OS.424

EBRT for Node-Positive Disease
EBRT with neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant ADT is the preferred
option for patients with clinical N1 disease. Abiraterone can be added. In
addition, ADT alone or with abiraterone are options. In each case, the use
of the fine-particle formulation of abiraterone is a category 2B
recommendation.

For adjuvant therapy for node-positive disease after radical prostatectomy,
see Adjuvant Therapy for pN1, below.

EBRT to the Primary Tumor in Low-Volume M1 Disease
Patients with newly diagnosed, low-volume metastatic prostate cancer can
be considered for ADT with EBRT to the primary tumor based on results
from the randomized controlled phase 3 STAMPEDE trial.333 In this
multicenter, international study, 2061 patients were randomized to lifelong
ADT with or without EBRT to the primary tumor (either 55 Gy in 20 daily
fractions over 4 weeks or 36 Gy in 6 weekly fractions over 6 weeks). The
primary outcome of OS by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was not met
(HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.80–1.06; P = .266), but EBRT improved the
secondary outcome of FFS (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68–0.84; P < .0001). In a
pre-planned subset analysis, outcomes of patients with high metastatic
burden (defined as visceral metastases; ≥4 bone metastases with ≥1
outside the vertebral bodies or pelvis; or both) and those with low
metastatic burden (all others) were determined. EBRT improved OS
(adjusted HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52–0.90), prostate cancer-specific survival
(adjusted HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47–0.90), FFS (adjusted HR, 0.59; 95% CI,
0.49–0.72), and PFS (adjusted HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63–0.98) in patients
with low metastatic burden, but not in patients with high metastatic burden.
Randomized clinical trials are ongoing to better test the value of removal
or radiation of the primary tumor in patients with low metastatic burden
who are beginning ADT.425-429

The Panel recommends against EBRT to the primary tumor in the case of
high-volume M1 disease based on the HORRAD and STAMPEDE
trials.333,430 No improvement in OS was seen from the addition of EBRT to
the primary when combined with standard systemic therapy in patients
with high-volume M1 disease in either trial.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy

The relatively slow proliferation rate of prostate cancer is reflected in a low
α/β ratio,431 most commonly reported between 1 and 4. These values are
similar to that for the rectal mucosa. Because the α/β ratio for prostate
cancer is similar to or lower than the surrounding tissues responsible for
most of the toxicity reported with radiation, appropriately designed
radiation treatment fields and schedules using extremely hypofractionated
regimens should result in similar cancer control rates without increased
risk of late toxicity.

SBRT is a technique that delivers highly conformal, high-dose radiation in
five or fewer treatment fractions, which are safe to administer only with
precise, image-guided delivery.432 Single-institution series with median
follow-up as long as 6 years report excellent biochemical PFS and similar
early toxicity (bladder, rectal, and QOL) compared to standard radiation
techniques.431-437 According to a pooled analysis of phase 2 trials, the 5-
year biochemical relapse-free survival is 95%, 84%, and 81% for patients
with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease, respectively.438 A study of
individual patient data from a cohort of 2142 patients with low- or
intermediate-risk prostate cancer from 10 single-institution phase 2 trials
and 2 multi-institutional phase 2 trials found that the 7-year cumulative
rates of biochemical recurrence were 4.5%, 8.6%, and 14.9% for low-risk
disease, favorable intermediate-risk disease, and unfavorable
intermediate-risk disease, respectively.439 Severe acute toxicity was rare,
at 0.6% for grade 3 or higher genitourinary toxic events and 0.09% for
grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal toxic events. Late (7-year cumulative
incidence) toxicity rates were 2.4% and 0.4% for grade 3 or higher
genitourinary toxic events and gastrointestinal toxic events, respectively.

= .001).440 Another phase 2 trial found increased toxicity with doses >47.5
Gy delivered in 5 fractions.441 An analysis using the SEER database also
reported that SBRT was more toxic than IMRT.442 Overall, prospective
evidence supports the use of SBRT in the setting of localized prostate
cancer.443

Several phase 3 trials have been initiated comparing conventional
regimens to SBRT.444-446 Preliminary results show that the genitourinary
and bowel toxicity is similar with the two techniques. In addition, the
HYPO-RT-PC trial demonstrated non-inferiority of 42.7 Gy in seven
fractions to 78.0 Gy in 39 fractions with respect to FFS in patients with
intermediate-to-high-risk prostate cancer.446

SBRT/extremely hypofractionated IG-IMRT regimens (6.5 Gy per fraction
or greater) can be considered as an alternative to conventionally
fractionated regimens at clinics with appropriate technology, physics, and
clinical expertise. Longer follow-up and prospective multi-institutional data
are required to evaluate longer-term results, especially because late
toxicity theoretically could be worse in hypofractionated regimens
compared to conventional fractionation (1.8–2.0 Gy per fraction).

Brachytherapy

Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive sources into the prostate
tissue. Brachytherapy has been used traditionally for low-risk cases
because earlier studies found it less effective than EBRT for high-risk
disease.94,447 However, increasing evidence suggests that technical
advancements in brachytherapy may provide a role for contemporary
brachytherapy in high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate
cancer.448,449

SBRT may be associated with more toxicity than moderately fractionated
IMRT. One retrospective study of 4005 patients reported higher
genitourinary toxicity at 24 months after SBRT than IMRT (44% vs. 36%; P

The advantage of brachytherapy is that the treatment is completed in 1
day with little time lost from normal activities. In appropriate patients, the
cancer-control rates appear comparable to radical prostatectomy (over

90%) for low-risk prostate cancer with medium-term follow-up.450 In
addition, the risk of incontinence is minimal in patients without a previous
transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and erectile function is
preserved in the short term.398 Disadvantages of brachytherapy include the
requirement for general anesthesia and the risk of acute urinary retention.
Irritative voiding symptoms may persist for as long as 1 year after
implantation. The risk of incontinence is greater after TURP because of
acute retention and bladder neck contractures, and many patients develop
progressive erectile dysfunction over several years. IMRT causes less
acute and late genitourinary toxicity and similar freedom from biochemical
recurrence compared with iodine-125 or palladium-103 permanent seed
implants.451,452 Current brachytherapy techniques attempt to improve the
radioactive seed placement and radiation dose distribution.

There are currently two methods for prostate brachytherapy: low dose-rate
(LDR) and high dose-rate (HDR). LDR brachytherapy consists of
placement of permanent seed implants in the prostate. The short range of
the radiation emitted from these low-energy sources allows delivery of
adequate dose levels to the cancer within the prostate, with excessive
irradiation of the bladder and rectum avoided. Post-implant dosimetry
should be performed to document the quality of an LDR implant.453 HDR
brachytherapy, which involves temporary insertion of a radiation source, is
a newer approach.

Two groups have observed a lower risk of urinary frequency, urgency, and
rectal pain with HDR brachytherapy compared with LDR brachytherapy
(permanent seed implant).454,455 Vargas and colleagues456 reported that
HDR brachytherapy results in a lower risk of erectile dysfunction than LDR
brachytherapy. Commonly prescribed doses for LDR and HDR
brachytherapy are listed in the guidelines.

For patients with very large or very small prostates, symptoms of bladder
outlet obstruction (high International Prostate Symptom Score), or a

previous TURP, seed implantation may be more difficult. These patients
also have an increased risk of side effects. Neoadjuvant ADT may be used
to shrink the prostate to an acceptable size; however, increased toxicity is
expected from ADT, and prostate size may not decline in some patients.
The potential toxicity of ADT must be weighed against the possible benefit
of target reduction.

Ideally, the accuracy of brachytherapy treatment should be verified by
daily prostate localization with techniques of IGRT: CT, ultrasound,
implanted fiducials, or electromagnetic targeting/tracking. Endorectal
balloons may be used to improve prostate immobilization. Perirectal
spacer materials (discussed under External Beam Radiation Therapy,
above) may be employed when the previously mentioned techniques are
insufficient to improve oncologic cure rates and/or reduce side effects due
to anatomic geometry or other patient-related factors (eg, medication
usage, comorbid conditions). Patients with obvious rectal invasion or
visible T3 and posterior extension should not undergo perirectal spacer
implantation.

Brachytherapy Alone for Localized Disease
Brachytherapy alone is an option for patients with very low, low, or
favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, depending on life expectancy.
Patients with high-risk cancers are generally considered poor candidates
for brachytherapy alone. Either LDR or HDR brachytherapy can be used in
this setting.

Retrospective analyses show that LDR or HDR brachytherapy alone can
be effective and well tolerated in this population.457-461 A phase 2 trial in
300 patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer also found LDR
brachytherapy alone to be safe and effective.462 However, randomized
controlled trials comparing brachytherapy to radical prostatectomy or
EBRT in this population are limited. In a single-center trial, 165 patients
with low-risk prostate cancer were randomized to LDR brachytherapy with

iodine-125 seeds or radical prostatectomy. The 2-year biochemical FFS
rates were similar between the groups at 96.1% after brachytherapy and
97.4% after radical prostatectomy (P = .35).463 At 6-month follow-up,
continence was better in the brachytherapy group whereas potency was
better in the radical prostatectomy group.

between the groups in most domains, except that physical and urinary
function scales were significantly lower in the LDR arm.474 Whereas the
toxicity is increased with the use of brachytherapy boost, this and other
randomized controlled trials have not shown an improvement in OS or
cancer-specific survival.475

Brachytherapy Boost
LDR or HDR brachytherapy can be added as a boost to EBRT plus ADT in
patients with unfavorable intermediate-, high-, or very-high-risk prostate
cancer being treated with curative intent. Combining EBRT and
brachytherapy allows dose escalation while minimizing acute or late
toxicity in patients with high-risk localized or locally advanced cancer.464-467
This combination has demonstrated improved biochemical control over
EBRT plus ADT alone in randomized trials, but with higher toxicity.468-470 An
analysis of a cohort of 12,745 patients with high-risk disease found that
treatment with brachytherapy (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49–0.86) or
brachytherapy plus EBRT (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66–0.90) lowered disease-
specific mortality compared to EBRT alone.471

Addition of ADT (2 or 3 years) to brachytherapy and EBRT is common for
patients at high risk of recurrence. The outcome of trimodality treatment is
excellent, with 9-year PFS and disease-specific survival reaching 87% and
91%, respectively.476,477 However, it remains unclear whether the ADT
component contributes to outcome improvement. D’Amico and colleagues
studied a cohort of 1342 patients with PSA over 20 ng/mL and clinical
T3/T4 and/or Gleason score 8 to 10 disease.478 Addition of either EBRT or
ADT to brachytherapy did not confer an advantage over brachytherapy
alone. The use of all three modalities reduced prostate cancer-specific
mortality compared to brachytherapy alone (adjusted HR, 0.32; 95% CI,
0.14–0.73). Other analyses did not find an improvement in recurrence rate
when ADT was added to brachytherapy and EBRT.479,480

The randomized ASCENDE-RT trial compared two methods of dose
escalation in 398 patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer:
dose-escalated EBRT boost to 78 Gy or LDR brachytherapy boost.472 All
patients were initially treated with 12 months of ADT and pelvic EBRT to
46 Gy. An ITT analysis found that the primary endpoint of biochemical
PFS was 89% versus 84% at 5 years; 86% versus 75% at 7 years; and
83% versus 62% at 9 years for the LDR versus EBRT boost arms (log-
rank P < .001). Toxicity was higher in the brachytherapy arm, with the
cumulative incidence of grade 3 genitourinary events at 5 years of 18.4%
for brachytherapy boost and 5.2% for EBRT boost (P < .001).473 A trend for
increased gastrointestinal toxicity with brachytherapy boost was also seen
(cumulative incidence of grade 3 events at 5 years, 8.1% vs. 3.2%; P =
.12). However, at 6-year follow-up, health-related QOL was similar

A large, multicenter, retrospective cohort analysis that included 1809
patients with Gleason score 9–10 prostate cancer found that multimodality
therapy with EBRT, brachytherapy, and ADT was associated with
improved prostate cancer-specific mortality and longer time to distant
metastasis than either radical prostatectomy or EBRT with ADT.481 In
addition, an analysis of outcomes of almost 43,000 patients with high-risk
prostate cancer in the National Cancer Database found that mortality was
similar in patients treated with EBRT, brachytherapy, and ADT versus
those treated with radical prostatectomy, but was worse in those treated
with EBRT and ADT.482

To address historical trial data concerns for increased toxicity incidence
associated with brachytherapy boost, careful patient selection and
contemporary planning associated with lesser toxicity, such as use of

recognized organ at risk dose constraints, use of high-quality ultrasound
and other imaging, and prescription of dose as close as possible to the
target without excessive margins should be implemented.

Post-Recurrence Brachytherapy
Brachytherapy can be considered in patients with biochemical recurrence
after EBRT. In a retrospective study of 24 patients who had EBRT as
primary therapy and permanent brachytherapy after biochemical
recurrence, the cancer-free and biochemical relapse-free survival rates
were 96% and 88%, respectively, after a median follow-up of 30 months.483
Results of a phase 2 study of post-recurrence HDR brachytherapy after
EBRT included relapse-free survival, distant metastases-free survival, and
cause-specific survival rates of 68.5%, 81.5%, and 90.3%, respectively, at
5 years.484 Toxicities were mostly grade 1 and 2 and included
gastrointestinal toxicity and urethral strictures, and one case of Grade 3
urinary incontinence. In another prospective phase 2 trial, the primary
endpoint of grade ≥3 late treatment-related gastrointestinal and
genitourinary adverse events at 9 to 24 months after post-recurrence
brachytherapy was below the unacceptable threshold, at 14%.485

Data on the use of brachytherapy after permanent brachytherapy are
limited, but the panel agrees that it can be considered for carefully
selected patients. Decisions regarding the use of brachytherapy in the
recurrent-disease setting should consider comorbidities, extent of disease,
and potential complications. Brachytherapy in this setting is best
performed at high-volume centers.

Proton Therapy

Proton beam RT has been used to treat patients with cancer since the
1950s. Proponents of proton therapy argue that this form of RT could have
advantages over x-ray (photon)-based radiation in certain clinical
circumstances. Proton therapy and x-ray–based therapies like IMRT can

deliver highly conformal doses to the prostate. Proton-based therapies will
deliver less radiation dose to some of the surrounding normal tissues like
muscle, bone, vessels, and fat not immediately adjacent to the prostate.
These tissues do not routinely contribute to the morbidity of prostate
radiation and are relatively resilient to radiation injury; therefore, the
benefit of decreased dose to these types of normal, non-critical tissues
has not been apparent. The critical normal structures adjacent to the
prostate that can create prostate cancer treatment morbidity include the
bladder, rectum, neurovascular bundles, and occasionally small bowel.

The weight of the current evidence about prostate cancer treatment
morbidity supports the notion that the volume of the rectum and bladder
that receives radiobiologically high doses of radiation near the prescription
radiation dose accounts for the likelihood of long-term treatment morbidity,
as opposed to higher volume, lower dose exposures. Numerous
dosimetric studies have been performed trying to compare x-ray–based
IMRT plans to proton therapy plans to illustrate how one or the other type
of treatment can be used to spare the bladder or rectum from higher dose
parts of the exposure. These studies suffer from the biases and talents of
the investigators who plan and create computer models of dose deposition
for one therapy or the other.486 Although dosimetric studies in-silico can
suggest that the right treatment planning can make an IMRT plan beat a
proton therapy plan and vice versa, they do not accurately predict clinically
meaningful endpoints.

Comparative effectiveness studies have been published in an attempt to
compare toxicity and oncologic outcomes between proton and photon
therapies. Two comparisons between patients treated with proton therapy
or EBRT report similar early toxicity rates.487,488 A prospective QOL
comparison of patient-reported outcomes using the EPIC instrument
between IMRT (204 patients) and proton therapy (1234 patients)
concluded that “No differences were observed in summary score changes

for bowel, urinary incontinence, urinary irritative/obstructive, and sexual
domains between the 2 cohorts” after up to 2 years of follow-up.489 A
Medicare analysis of 421 patients treated with proton therapy and a
matched cohort of 842 patients treated with IMRT showed less
genitourinary toxicity at 6 months for protons, although the difference
disappeared after 1 year.488 No other significant differences were seen
between the groups. In contrast, a single-center report of prospectively
collected QOL data revealed significant problems with incontinence, bowel
dysfunction, and impotence at 3 months, 12 months, and greater than 2
years after treatment with proton therapy.487 In that report, only 28% of
patients with normal erectile function maintained it after therapy. The
largest retrospective comparative effectiveness analysis to date comparing
IMRT to proton therapy was performed using SEER-Medicare claims data
for the following long-term endpoints: gastrointestinal morbidity, urinary
incontinence, non-incontinence urinary morbidity, sexual dysfunction, and
hip fractures.490 With follow-up as mature as 80 months and using both
propensity scoring and instrumental variable analysis, the authors
concluded that patients receiving IMRT therapy had statistically
significantly lower gastrointestinal morbidity than patients receiving proton
therapy, whereas rates of urinary incontinence, non-incontinence urinary
morbidity, sexual dysfunction, hip fractures, and additional cancer
therapies were statistically indistinguishable between the cohorts.
However, firm conclusions regarding differences in toxicity or effectiveness
of proton and photon therapy cannot be drawn because of the limitations
inherent in retrospective/observational studies.

The costs associated with proton beam facility construction and proton
beam treatment are high compared to the expense of building and using
the more common photon linear accelerator-based practice.488 The
American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) evaluated proton
therapy and created a model policy to support the society’s position on
payment coverage for proton beam therapy in 2014.491 This model policy

was updated in 2017 and recommends coverage of proton therapy for the
treatment of non-metastatic prostate cancer if the patient is enrolled in
either an institutional review board (IRB)-approved study or a multi-
institutional registry that adheres to Medicare requirements for Coverage
with Evidence Development (CED). The policy states: “In the treatment of
prostate cancer, the use of [proton beam therapy] is evolving as the
comparative efficacy evidence is still being developed. In order for an
informed consensus on the role of [proton beam therapy] for prostate
cancer to be reached, it is essential to collect further data, especially to
understand how the effectiveness of proton therapy compares to other RT
modalities such as IMRT and brachytherapy. There is a need for more
well-designed registries and studies with sizable comparator cohorts to
help accelerate data collection. Proton beam therapy for primary treatment
of prostate cancer should only be performed within the context of a
prospective clinical trial or registry.”

A prospective phase 2 clinical trial enrolled 184 patients with low- or
intermediate-risk prostate cancer who received 70 Gy of hypofractionated
proton therapy in 28 fractions.492 The 4-year rate of biochemical-clinical
FFS was 93.5% (95% CI, 89%–98%). Grade ≥2 acute GI and urologic
toxicity rates were 3.8% and 12.5%, respectively. Late GI and urologic
toxicity rates were 7.6% and 13.6%, respectively, at 4 years.

The NCCN Panel believes no clear evidence supports a benefit or
decrement to proton therapy over IMRT for either treatment efficacy or
long-term toxicity. Conventionally fractionated prostate proton therapy can
be considered a reasonable alternative to x-ray–based regimens at clinics
with appropriate technology, physics, and clinical expertise.

Radiation for Distant Metastases

prostate cancer. Studies have confirmed the common practice in Canada

and Europe of managing prostate cancer with bone metastases with a
short course of radiation to the bone. A short course of 8 Gy x 1 is as
effective as, and less costly than, 30 Gy in 10 fractions.493 In a randomized
trial of 898 patients with bone metastases, grade 2–4 acute toxicity was
observed less often in the 8-Gy arm (10%) than in the 30-Gy arm (17%) (P
= .002); however, the retreatment rate was higher in the 8-Gy group (18%)
than in the 30-Gy group (9%) (P < .001).494 In another study of 425
patients with painful bone metastases, a single dose of 8 Gy was non-
inferior to 20 Gy in multiple fractions in terms of overall pain response to
treatment.495 The SCORAD randomized trial did not show non-inferiority
for ambulatory status of single-fraction 8-Gy EBRT to 20 Gy in 5
fractions.496

The Panel notes that 8 Gy as a single dose is as effective for pain
palliation at any bony site as longer courses of radiation, but re-treatment
rates are higher. Other regimens (ie, 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 37.5 Gy in 15
fractions) may be used as alternative palliative dosing depending on
clinical scenario (both category 2B).

Radiation to metastases has also been studied in the oligometastatic
setting. The ORIOLE phase 2 randomized trial randomized 54 patients
with recurrent castration-naïve prostate cancer and 1 to 3 metastases to
receive SABR or observation at a 2:1 ratio.497 The primary outcome
measure was progression at 6 months by increasing PSA, progression
detected by conventional imaging, symptomatic progression, initiation of
ADT for any reason, or death. Progression at 6 months was lower in
patients in the SABR arm than in the observation arm (19% vs. 61%; P =
.005). The secondary endpoint of PFS was also improved in the patients
who received SABR (not reached vs. 5.8 months; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11–
0.81; P = .002). The SABR-COMET phase 2, international trial
randomized 99 patients with controlled primary tumors and 1 to 5
metastatic lesions at 10 centers to standard of care or standard of care

plus SABR.498 Sixteen patients had prostate cancer. After a median follow-
up of 51 months, the 5-year OS rate was higher in the SABR group
(17.7% vs. 42.3%; stratified log-rank P = .006), as was the 5-year PFS
rate (3.2% vs. 17.3%; P = .001). No differences were seen in adverse
events or QOL.

The Panel believes that SBRT to metastases can be considered in the
following circumstances:

•

•
•

In patients with limited metastatic disease to the vertebra or
paravertebral region when ablation is the goal (eg, concern for
impending fracture or tumor encroachment on spinal nerves or
vertebra).
In patients with oligometastatic progression where PFS is the goal.
In symptomatic patients where the lesion occurs in or immediately
adjacent to a previously irradiated treatment field.

Comparison of Treatment Options for Localized Disease

Several large prospective, population/cohort-based studies have
compared the outcomes of patients with localized prostate cancer treated
with EBRT, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, observation, and/or
active surveillance. Barocas et al compared radical prostatectomy, EBRT,
and active surveillance in 2550 patients and found that, after 3 years,
radical prostatectomy was associated with a greater decrease in urinary
and sexual function than either EBRT or active surveillance.499 Active
surveillance, however, was associated with an increase in urinary irritative
symptoms. Health-related QOL measures including bowel and hormonal
function were similar among the groups, as was disease-specific survival.

Chen et al compared radical prostatectomy, EBRT, and brachytherapy
against active surveillance in 1141 patients.500 As in the Barocas study,
radical prostatectomy was associated with greater declines in sexual and
urinary function than other treatments at 3 months. In this study, EBRT

was associated with worse short-term bowel function, and both EBRT and
brachytherapy were associated with worsened urinary obstructive and
irritative symptoms. By 2 years, however, differences among the groups
compared with active surveillance were insignificant. Results of a
systematic review showed similar findings to these studies.501

Another study examined patient-reported outcomes in greater than 2000
patients with localized prostate cancer managed by radical prostatectomy,
brachytherapy, EBRT with or without ADT, or active surveillance.502 By 5
years, most functional differences were minimal between management
approaches. However, radical prostatectomy was associated with worse
incontinence in the full cohort and with worse sexual function in those with
unfavorable intermediate-, high-, or very-high-risk disease than those
treated with EBRT and ADT.

Other Local Therapies

Many therapies have been investigated for the treatment of localized
prostate cancer in the initial disease and recurrent settings, with the goals
of reducing side effects and matching the cancer control of other
therapies. Cryotherapy or other local therapies are not recommended as
routine primary therapy for localized prostate cancer due to lack of long-
term data comparing these treatments to radiation or radical
prostatectomy. At this time, the panel recommends only cryosurgery and
high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU; category 2B) as local therapy
options for RT recurrence in the absence of metastatic disease.

Cryosurgery, also known as cryotherapy or cryoablation, is an evolving
minimally invasive therapy that damages tumor tissue through local
freezing. In the initial disease setting, the reported 5-year biochemical
disease-free rate after cryotherapy ranged from 65% to 92% in patients
with low-risk disease using different definitions of biochemical
recurrence.503 A report suggests that cryotherapy and radical

prostatectomy give similar oncologic results for unilateral prostate
cancer.504 A study by Donnelly and colleagues505 randomly assigned 244
patients with T2 or T3 disease to either cryotherapy or EBRT. All patients
received neoadjuvant ADT. There was no difference in 3-year OS or DFS.
Patients who received cryotherapy reported poorer sexual function.506 For
patients with locally advanced cancer, cryoablation was associated with
lower 8-year biochemical progression-free rate compared to EBRT in a
small trial of 62 patients, although disease-specific survival and OS were
similar.507

Cryosurgery has been assessed in patients with recurrent disease after
RT.508-510 In one registry-based study of 91 patients, the biochemical DFS
rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 95.3%, 72.4%, and 46.5%, respectively.
Adverse events included urinary retention (6.6%), incontinence (5.5%),
and rectourethral fistula (3.3%).510

HIFU has been studied for treatment of initial disease.511,512 A prospective
multi-institutional study used HIFU in 111 patients with localized prostate
cancer.511 The radical treatment-free survival rate was 89% at 2 years, and
continence and erectile functions were preserved in 97% and 78% of
patients, respectively, at 12 months. Morbidity was acceptable, with a
grade III complication rate of 13%. In another prospective multi-
institutional study, 625 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated
with HIFU.513 Eighty-four percent of the cohort had intermediate- or high-
risk disease. The primary endpoint of FFS was 88% at 5 years (95% CI,
85%–91%). Pad-free urinary continence was reported by 98% of
participants. Other case series studies have seen similar results.514,515

HIFU also has been studied for treatment of radiation recurrence.516-522
Analysis of a prospective registry of patients treated with HIFU for
radiation recurrence revealed median biochemical recurrence-free survival
at 63 months, 5-year OS of 88%, and cancer-specific survival of 94%.523
Morbidity was acceptable, with a grade III/IV complication rate of 3.6%.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Analysis of a separate prospective registry showed that 48% of those who
received HIFU following radiotherapy recurrence were able to avoid ADT
at a median follow-up of 64 months.524

Other emerging local therapies, such as focal laser ablation and vascular-
targeted photodynamic (VTP) therapy have also been studied.525,526 The
multicenter, open-label, phase 3, randomized controlled CLIN1001
PCM301 trial compared VTP therapy (IV padeliporfin, optical fibers
inserted into the prostate, and subsequent laser activation) to active
surveillance in 413 patients with low-risk prostate cancer.527 After a median
follow-up of 24 months, 28% of participants in the VTP arm had disease
progression compared with 58% in the active surveillance arm (adjusted
HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.24–0.46; P < .0001). Negative prostate biopsy results
were more prevalent in the VTP group (49% vs. 14%; adjusted RR, 3.67;
95% CI, 2.53–5.33; P < .0001). The most common serious adverse event
in the VTP group was urinary retention (3 of 206 patients), which resolved
within 2 months in all cases.

Disease Monitoring

Please refer to the NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship (available at
www.NCCN.org) for recommendations regarding common consequences
of cancer and cancer treatment (eg, cardiovascular disease risk
assessment; anxiety, depression, trauma, and distress; hormone-related
symptoms; sexual dysfunction) and on the promotion of physical activity,
weight management, and proper immunizations in survivors.

Patients After Initial Definitive Therapy

For patients initially treated with intent to cure, serum PSA levels should
be measured every 6 to 12 months for the first 5 years and then annually.
PSA testing every 3 months may be better for patients at high risk of
recurrence. When prostate cancer recurred after radical prostatectomy,
Pound and colleagues found that 45% of patients experienced recurrence

within the first 2 years, 77% within the first 5 years, and 96% by 10
years.528 Local recurrence may result in substantial morbidity and can, in
rare cases, occur in the absence of a PSA elevation. Therefore, annual
DRE is appropriate to monitor for prostate cancer recurrence and to detect
colorectal cancer. Similarly, after RT, the monitoring of serum PSA levels
is recommended every 6 months for the first 5 years and then annually
and a DRE is recommended annually. The clinician may opt to omit the
DRE if PSA levels remain undetectable.

Patients with Castration-Naïve Disease on ADT

The intensity of clinical monitoring for patients on ADT for castration-naïve
disease is determined by the response to initial ADT, EBRT, or both.
Follow-up evaluation of these patients should include history and physical
examination and PSA measurement every 3 to 6 months based on clinical
judgment. Imaging can be considered periodically to monitor treatment
response. The relative risk for bone metastasis or death increases as
PSADT falls; a major inflection point appears at PSADT of 8 months. Bone
imaging should be performed more frequently in these patients.529

Patients with Localized Disease Under Observation

Patients with localized disease on observation follow the same monitoring
recommendations as patients with castration-naïve disease who are on
ADT, except that the physical exam and PSA measurement should only
be done every 6 months.

Workup for Progression

Castrate levels of testosterone should be documented if clinically indicated
in patients with signs of progression, with adjustment of ADT as
necessary. If serum testosterone levels are <50 ng/dL, the patient should
undergo disease workup with bone and soft tissue imaging (see Imaging
Techniques above for more details):

feel that conventional imaging is a necessary prerequisite
to PSMA-PET and that PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI
can serve as an equally effective, if not more effective front-
line imaging tool for these patients.

ASCO has published guidelines on the optimal imaging strategies for
patients with advanced prostate cancer.530 ASCO recommendations are
generally consistent with those provided here.

Post-Radical Prostatectomy Treatment

Most patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy are cured of
prostate cancer. However, some patients will have adverse pathologic
features, positive lymph nodes, or biochemical persistence or recurrence.
Some patients have detectable PSA after radical prostatectomy due to
benign prostate tissue in the prostate fossa. They have low stable PSAs
and a very low risk of prostate cancer progression.531,532 Serial PSA

measurements can be helpful for stratifying patients at highest risk of
progression and metastases.

Selecting patients appropriately for adjuvant radiation is difficult.

Adjuvant/Early Treatment for Adverse Features

Adjuvant radiation with or without ADT can be given to patients with PSA
persistence (PSA does not fall to undetectable levels) or adverse
pathologic features (ie, positive margins, seminal vesicle invasion,
extracapsular extension) who do not have lymph node metastases.
Positive surgical margins are unfavorable, especially if diffuse (>10-mm
margin involvement or ≥3 sites of positivity) or associated with persistent
serum levels of PSA. The defined target volumes include the prostate
bed.533 Monitoring after radical prostatectomy is also appropriate, with
consideration of early EBRT for a detectable and rising PSA or PSA >0.1
ng/mL.

Decisions about when to initiate post-radical prostatectomy radiation and
whether to include ADT are complex. The Panel recommends use of
nomograms and consideration of age and comorbidities, clinical and
pathologic information, PSA levels, PSADT, and Decipher molecular
assay to individualize treatment discussion. Older trials conducted by
SWOG and EORTC showed that post-prostatectomy adjuvant radiation
improved biochemical PFS in patients with extraprostatic disease at
radical prostatectomy.534-536 More recent randomized trials that used
modern surgical and radiation techniques provide high-level evidence that
can be used to counsel patients and are discussed herein.

In the RADICALS-RT trial, 1396 patients with adverse features after
radical prostatectomy were followed for a median 4.9 years and no
differences were seen in 5-year biochemical PFS and freedom from non-
protocol hormone therapy.537 However, urinary incontinence and grade 3–
4 urethral strictures were more frequent in the adjuvant therapy group. The

Prostate Cancer

GETUG-AFU 17 trial and the TROG 08.03/ANZUP RAVES trial were both
terminated early for unexpectedly low event rates, but similarly found no
evidence of oncologic benefit with increased risk of genitourinary toxicity
and erectile dysfunction when adjuvant therapy was used.538,539 Another
randomized trial, however, saw an improvement in 10-year survival for
biochemical recurrence with the use of adjuvant therapy (HR, 0.26; 95%
CI, 0.14–0.48; P < .001).540

Systematic reviews come to conflicting conclusions on the utility of
immediate post-prostatectomy radiation in patients with adverse
features.541,542 A retrospective cohort analysis of more than 26,000 patients
concluded that patients with adverse features after radical prostatectomy
(ie, Gleason 8–10; pT3/4; pN1) should be candidates for adjuvant
radiation because a reduction in all-cause mortality was observed in such
patients.543

A limited amount of data inform the decision regarding the addition of ADT
to EBRT in this setting. The ongoing SPPORT trial (NCT00567580) of
patients with PSA levels between 0.1 and 2.0 ng/mL at least 6 weeks after
radical prostatectomy has reported preliminary results on clinicaltrials.gov.
The primary outcome measure of percentage of participants free from
progression (FFP) at 5 years was 70.3 (95% CI, 66.2–74.3) for those who
received EBRT to the prostate bed and 81.3 (95% CI, 77.9–84.6) for those
who received EBRT with 4 to 6 months of ADT (luteinizing hormone-
releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist plus antiandrogen). Results of a
retrospective analysis of radical prostatectomy specimens from patients in
RTOG 9601 suggest that those with low PSA and a low Decipher score
derived less benefit (development of distant metastases, OS) from
bicalutamide than those with a high Decipher score.544 Patients with high
Decipher genomic classifier scores (GC >0.6) should be strongly
considered for EBRT and addition of ADT when the opportunity for early
EBRT has been missed.

Overall, the Panel believes that adjuvant or early EBRT after recuperation
from operation may be beneficial in patients with one or more adverse
laboratory or pathologic features, which include positive surgical margin,
seminal vesicle invasion, and/or extracapsular extension as noted in the
guideline by the American Urological Association (AUA) and ASTRO.545

The value of whole pelvic irradiation in this setting is unclear due to a lack
of benefit in PFS in two trials (RTOG 9413 and GETUG 01)416,417,546,547;
whole pelvic radiation may be appropriate for selected patients.

Adjuvant Therapy for pN1

Adjuvant therapy can also be given to patients with positive lymph nodes
found during or after radical prostatectomy. Several management options
should be considered. ADT is a category 1 option, as discussed below
(see Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for
Regional Disease).548 Retrospective data show that initial observation may
be safe in some patients with N1 disease at radical prostatectomy,
because 28% of a cohort of 369 patients remained free from biochemical
recurrence at 10 years.549 Therefore, another option is monitoring with
consideration of early treatment for a detectable and rising PSA or PSA
>0.1 ng/mL, based further on extrapolation of data from RADICALS-RT,
GETUG-AFU 17, and TROG 08.03/ANZUP RAVES.537-539 A third option is
the addition of pelvic EBRT to ADT (category 2B). This last
recommendation is based on retrospective studies and a National Cancer
Database analysis that demonstrated improved biochemical recurrence-
free survival, cancer-specific survival, and all-cause survival with post-
prostatectomy EBRT and ADT compared to adjuvant ADT alone in
patients with lymph node metastases.550-553

Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy

Patients who experience biochemical recurrence after radical
prostatectomy fall into three groups: 1) those whose PSA level does not

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

fall to undetectable levels after radical prostatectomy (persistent disease);
2) those who achieve an undetectable PSA after radical prostatectomy
with a subsequent detectable PSA level that increases on two or more
subsequent laboratory determinations (PSA recurrence); or 3) the
occasional case with persistent but low PSA levels attributed to slow PSA
metabolism or residual benign tissue. Consensus has not defined a
threshold level of PSA below which PSA is truly “undetectable.”531 Group 3
does not require further evaluation until PSA increases, but the workup for
1 and 2 must include an evaluation for distant metastases.

Several retrospective studies have assessed the prognostic value of
various combinations of pretreatment PSA levels, Gleason scores,
PSADT, and the presence or absence of positive surgical margins.554-558 A
large retrospective review of 501 patients who received radiation for
detectable and increasing PSA after radical prostatectomy557 showed that
the predictors of progression were Gleason score 8 to 10, pre-EBRT PSA
level >2 ng/mL, seminal vesicle invasion, negative surgical margins, and
PSADT ≤10 months. However, prediction of systemic disease versus local
recurrence and hence responsiveness to postoperative radiation has
proven unfeasible for individual patients using clinical and pathologic
criteria.559 Delivery of adjuvant or post-recurrence EBRT becomes both
therapeutic and diagnostic—PSA response indicates local
persistence/recurrence. Delayed biochemical recurrence requires
restaging, and a nomogram118,560 may prove useful to predict response, but
it has not been validated.

The utility of imaging for patients with an early biochemical recurrence
after radical prostatectomy depends on disease risk before operation and
pathologic stage, Gleason grade, PSA, and PSADT after recurrence.
Patients with low- and intermediate-risk disease and low postoperative
serum PSA levels have a very low risk of positive bone scans or CT
scans.561,562 In a series of 414 bone scans performed in 230 patients with

biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, the rate of a positive
bone scan for patients with PSA >10 ng/mL was only 4%.563

The specific staging tests depend on the clinical history, but should include
a calculation of PSADT to inform nomogram use and counseling. In
addition, bone imaging; chest CT; abdominal/pelvic CT or
abdominal/pelvic MRI; C-11 choline PET/CT or PET/MRI or F-18
fluciclovine PET/CT or PET/MRI; and prostate bed biopsy may be useful.
The Decipher molecular assay can be considered for prognostication after
radical prostatectomy (category 2B). A meta-analysis of five studies with
855 patients and median follow-up of 8 years found that the 10-year
cumulative incidence metastases rates for patients classified as low,
intermediate, and high risk by Decipher after radical prostatectomy were
5.5%, 15.0%, and 26.7%, respectively (P < .001).564

Bone imaging is appropriate when patients develop symptoms or when
PSA levels are increasing rapidly. In one study, the probability of a positive
bone scan for a patient not on ADT after radical prostatectomy was less
than 5% unless the PSA increased to 40 to 45 ng/mL.565 A prostate bed
biopsy may be helpful when imaging suggests local recurrence.

Patients with PSA recurrence (undetectable PSA that increases on two or
more measurements) after radical prostatectomy may be observed or
undergo primary EBRT with or without ADT if distant metastases are not
detected.

Large retrospective cohort studies support the use of EBRT in the setting
of biochemical recurrence, because it is associated with decreased all-
cause mortality and increased prostate cancer-specific survival.559,566 The
recommended post-radical prostatectomy EBRT dose is 64 to 72 Gy and
may be increased for gross recurrence that has been proven by biopsy.
The target volume includes the prostate bed and may include the whole
pelvis in selected patients.533 Treatment is most effective when pre-

Prostate Cancer

treatment PSA level is below 0.5 ng/mL.560 Paradoxically, post-recurrence
EBRT was shown to be most beneficial when the PSADT time was less
than 6 months in a cohort analysis of 635 patients,559 although another
study of 519 patients reported mortality reduction for both those with
PSADT less than 6 months and those with PSADT greater than or equal to
6 months.566 Most patients with prolonged PSADT may be observed
safely.567

Six months of concurrent/adjuvant ADT can be coadministered with
radiation in patients with rising PSA levels based on the results of
GETUG-16.568,569 However, a secondary analysis of RTOG 9601 found that
patients with PSA ≤0.6 ng/mL had no OS improvement with the addition of
bicalutamide to EBRT.570 Two years instead of 6 months of ADT can be
considered in addition to radiation for patients with persistent PSA after
radical prostatectomy or for PSA levels that exceed 1.0 ng/mL at the time
of initiation of therapy, based on results of RTOG 9601.571 For 2 years of
ADT, level 1 evidence supports 150 mg bicalutamide daily but an LHRH
agonist could be considered as an alternative.571

ADT alone becomes the treatment when there is proven or high suspicion
for distant metastases after PSA recurrence. Pelvic radiation is not
recommended but may be given to the site of bone metastasis if in weight-
bearing bones or if the patient is symptomatic. Observation remains
acceptable for selected patients, with ADT delayed until symptoms
develop or PSA levels suggest that symptoms are imminent. In all cases,
the form of primary or secondary systemic therapy should be based on the
hormonal status of the patient.

Post-Radiation Recurrence

The 2006 Phoenix definition was revised by ASTRO and the RTOG in
Phoenix: 1) PSA rise by 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir PSA is the
standard definition for biochemical recurrence after EBRT with or without

hormonal therapy; and 2) A recurrence evaluation should be considered
when PSA has been confirmed to be increasing after radiation even if the
rise above nadir is not yet 2 ng/mL, especially in candidates for additional
local therapy who are young and healthy.572 Retaining a strict version of
the ASTRO definition allows comparison with a large existing body of
literature. Rapid increase of PSA may warrant evaluation (prostate biopsy)
prior to meeting the Phoenix definition, especially in younger or healthier
patients.

Workup for RT recurrence typically includes PSADT calculation, bone
imaging, TRUS biopsy, and prostate MRI; in addition, a chest CT, an
abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI, C-11 choline PET/CT or
PET/MRI, or F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered.

Local radiation recurrences are most responsive to additional therapy
when PSA levels at the time of treatment are low (<5 ng/mL). Biopsy
should be encouraged at the time of radiation biochemical recurrence if
staging workup does not reveal metastatic disease. Prostate biopsy in the
setting of suspected local recurrence after radiation should be considered,
including biopsy at the junction of the seminal vesicle and prostate,
because this is a common site of recurrence.

Options for therapy for those with positive biopsy but low suspicion of
metastases to distant organs and a life expectancy greater than 10 years
include observation or radical prostatectomy with PLND in selected cases
by highly experienced surgeons. Radical prostatectomy after RT
recurrence can result in long-term disease control, but is often associated
with impotence and urinary incontinence.573 Other options for localized
interventions include cryotherapy,574 HIFU (category 2B),516-519,523,524 and
brachytherapy (reviewed by Allen and colleagues575 and discussed in
Post-Recurrence Brachytherapy, above). Treatment, however, needs to
be individualized based on the patient's risk of progression, the likelihood
of success, and the risks involved with therapy. For those with a life

Prostate Cancer

expectancy less than or equal to 10 years, positive biopsy, and no distant
metastases, observation or ADT are appropriate options.

Negative TRUS biopsy after post-radiation biochemical recurrence poses
clinical uncertainties. Therefore, mpMRI or full-body PET imaging can be
considered (see Imaging Techniques, above). In the absence of
detectable metastases with a negative biopsy, observation or ADT are
options for patients with PSA recurrence after radiation.

Patients with radiographic evidence of distant metastases should proceed
to ADT for castration-naïve disease.

Androgen Deprivation Therapy

ADT is administered as primary systemic therapy for regional or advanced
disease and as neoadjuvant/concomitant/adjuvant therapy in combination
with radiation in localized or locally advanced prostate cancers.

In the community, ADT has been commonly used as primary therapy for
early-stage, low-risk disease, especially in the patients who are older. This
practice has been challenged by a large cohort study of 66,717 patients
≥66 years of age with T1–T2 tumors.576 No 15-year survival benefit was
found in patients receiving ADT compared to observation alone. Similarly,
another cohort study of 15,170 patients diagnosed with clinically localized
prostate cancer who were not treated with curative intent therapy reported
no survival benefit from primary ADT after adjusting for demographic and
clinical variables.577 Placing patients with early prostate cancer on ADT
should not be routine practice.

Antiandrogen monotherapy (bicalutamide) after completion of primary
treatment was investigated as an adjuvant therapy in patients with
localized or locally advanced prostate cancer, but results did not support
its use in this setting.578,579

Castrate levels of serum testosterone (<50 ng/dL; <1.7 nmol/L) should be
achieved with ADT, because low nadir serum testosterone levels were
shown to be associated with improved cause-specific survival in the PR-7
study.580 Patients who do not achieve adequate suppression of serum
testosterone (<50 ng/dL) with medical or surgical castration can be
considered for additional hormonal manipulations (with estrogen,
antiandrogens, LHRH antagonists, or steroids), although the clinical
benefit remains uncertain. Monitoring testosterone levels 12 weeks after
first dose of LHRH therapy and upon increase in PSA should be
considered.

ADT for Clinically Localized (N0,M0) Disease

ADT should not be used as monotherapy in clinically localized prostate
cancer unless there is a contraindication to definitive local therapy, such
as life expectancy less than 5 years and comorbidities. Under those
circumstances, ADT may be an acceptable alternative if the disease is
high or very high risk (see Palliative ADT, below).

In the clinically localized setting, ADT using an LHRH agonist—alone or
with a first-generation antiandrogen—or an LHRH antagonist can be used
as a neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant to EBRT in patients with
unfavorable intermediate-, high-, or very-high-risk prostate cancer, as
described in more detail below.

ADT used as neoadjuvant treatment before radical prostatectomy is
strongly discouraged outside of a clinical trial.

Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for
Intermediate-Risk Disease
The addition of short-term ADT to radiation improved OS and cancer-
specific survival in three randomized trials containing 20% to 60% of
patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (Trans Tasman Radiation
Oncology Group [TROG] 9601, Dana Farber Cancer Institute [DFCI]

Prostate Cancer

95096, and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] 9408).571,581-583
Only a cancer-specific survival benefit was noted in a fourth trial that
recruited mostly patients with high-risk disease (RTOG 8610).584 Results of
the EORTC 22991 trial showed that the addition of 6 months of ADT
significantly improved biochemical DFS compared with radiation alone in
those with intermediate-risk (75% of study population) and high-risk
disease.585 A secondary analysis of the RTOG 9408 trial showed that the
benefit of ADT given with EBRT in patients intermediate-risk prostate
cancer was limited to those in the unfavorable subset.586

RTOG 9910 and RTOG 9902 reinforced two important principles
concerning the optimal duration of ADT and use of systemic
chemotherapy in conjunction with EBRT.587,588 RTOG 9910 is a phase 3
randomized trial targeting patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer
that compared 4 months to 9 months of ADT. RTOG 9408 had previously
shown that 4 months of ADT combined with EBRT improved survival in
those with intermediate-risk disease compared to EBRT alone.583
Consistent with earlier studies, RTOG 9910 demonstrated that there is no
reason to extend ADT beyond 4 months when given in conjunction with
EBRT in patients with intermediate-risk disease.

RTOG 9902 compared long-term ADT and EBRT with and without
paclitaxel, estramustine, and etoposide (TEE) chemotherapy in patients
with locally advanced, high-risk prostate cancer.589 In the randomized
cohort of 397 patients with a median follow-up of 9.2 years, results
demonstrated no significant difference in ADT+EBRT versus
ADT+EBRT+TEE in OS (65% vs. 63%; P = .81), biochemical recurrence
(58% vs. 54%; P = .82), distant metastases (16% vs. 14%; P = .42), or
DFS (22% vs. 26%; P = .61), but a substantial increase in toxicity (3.9%
vs. 0% treatment-related deaths), which resulted in early closure of the
trial.589 Thus, the fact that 6 months of ADT improved survival compared to
EBRT alone does not mean it is better than 4 months of ADT, and the fact

that systemic chemotherapy is effective in one setting (high-volume
metastatic disease or CRPC) should not lead to the assumption that it will
be beneficial in other settings (eg, high-risk localized disease).590,591

At this time, the Panel recommends 4 to 6 months of ADT when EBRT is
given to patients as initial treatment of unfavorable intermediate-risk
prostate cancer. If brachytherapy is added to EBRT in this setting, then 4
to 6 months of ADT is optional.

Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for High-Risk or
Very-High-Risk Disease
ADT combined with EBRT is an effective primary treatment for patients at
high risk or very high risk, as discussed in the Radiation Therapy section
above. Combination therapy was consistently associated with improved
disease-specific survival and OS compared to single-modality treatment in
randomized phase 3 studies.408,409,411,412,592

Increasing evidence favors long-term over short-term
neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT for patients with high- and very-
high-risk disease. The RTOG 9202 trial included 1521 patients with T2c-
T4 prostate cancer who received 4 months of ADT before and during
EBRT.593 They were randomized to no further treatment or an additional 2
years of ADT. At 10 years, the long-term group was superior for all
endpoints except OS. A subgroup analysis of patients with a Gleason
score of 8 to 10 found an advantage in OS for long-term ADT at 10 years
(32% vs. 45%, P = .0061). At a median follow-up of 19.6 years, long-term
ADT was superior for all endpoints including OS in the entire cohort (12%
relative reduction; P = .03).594

The EORTC 22961 trial also showed superior survival when 2.5 years of
ADT were added to EBRT given with 6 months of ADT in 970 patients,
most of whom had T2c–T3, N0 disease.595 The DART01/05 GICOR trial
also reported similar results in patients with high-risk disease.596 In a

secondary analysis of RTOG 8531, which mandated lifelong ADT for
patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with EBRT, those
who adhered to the protocol had better survival than those who
discontinued ADT within 5 years.597 Two randomized phase 3 trials
showed 1.5 years of ADT was not inferior to 3 years of ADT.598,599

A meta-analysis of data from 992 patients enrolled in 6 randomized
controlled trials showed that a longer duration of ADT with EBRT benefited
patients with Grade Group 4 or 5 prostate cancer.600

Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for Recurrent
Disease
Patients who develop PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy without
evidence of metastases can receive pelvic EBRT with
neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT (see ADT for M0 Biochemical
Recurrence, below).

ADT for Regional Disease

Primary ADT for Lymph Node Metastases
Patients initially diagnosed with node-positive disease who have a life
expectancy greater than 5 years can be treated with primary ADT. Primary
ADT options are orchiectomy, an LHRH agonist, an LHRH agonist with a
first-generation antiandrogen, or an LHRH antagonist (category 2B); or
orchiectomy, LHRH agonist, or LHRH antagonist with abiraterone. Another
option for these patients is EBRT with 2 to 3 years of
neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT (category 1, see Neoadjuvant,
Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for Regional Disease,
below). For those patients with N1 disease who are treated with radiation
to the prostate and pelvic nodes, abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) with
ADT should be considered for a total of 2 years. Abiraterone should not be
coadministered with an antiandrogen (see Abiraterone Acetate in
Castration-Naïve Prostate Cancer, below).

The EORTC 30846 trial randomized 234 treatment-naïve patients with
node-positive prostate cancer to immediate versus delayed ADT.601 At 13
years median follow-up, the authors reported similar survival between the
two arms, although the study was not powered to show non-inferiority.

Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for Regional
Disease
Patients initially diagnosed with pelvic lymph node-positive disease who
have a life expectancy greater than 5 years can be treated with EBRT with
2 to 3 years of neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT (category 1) with or
without abiraterone. Alternatively, they can receive primary ADT without
EBRT with or without abiraterone (see Primary ADT for Lymph Node
Metastases, above and Abiraterone Acetate in Castration-Naïve Prostate
Cancer, below). Neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT options are an
LHRH agonist, an LHRH agonist with a first-generation antiandrogen, or
an LHRH antagonist. Abiraterone should not be coadministered with an
antiandrogen.

The role of adjuvant ADT after radical prostatectomy is restricted to cases
where positive pelvic lymph nodes are found, although reports in this area
reveal mixed findings. Messing and colleagues randomly assigned 98
patients who were found to have positive lymph nodes at the time of
radical prostatectomy to immediate continuous ADT or observation.548 In
the immediate ADT arm of 47 patients, 30 remained alive, 29 of whom
were prostate cancer recurrence-free and 26 of whom were PSA
recurrence-free after a median follow-up of 11.9 years (range, 9.7–14.5
years for survivors).548,602 Those receiving immediate ADT also had a
significant improvement in OS (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.01–3.35).

However, these results differ from a SEER Medicare, population-based
test of ADT published subsequently.603 The SEER Medicare-based study
of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and had positive lymph
nodes used propensity matching to compare patients who received ADT

Prostate Cancer

within 120 days to those who were observed. The groups had similar
median and range of follow-up for survivors, but OS and prostate cancer-
specific survival were similar. The Messing study occurred prior to the
PSA era, but the studies are similar in almost all other respects. The
Messing study showed almost unbelievable benefit, and the population-
based study of 731 patients showed no benefit. Furthermore, a meta-
analysis resulted in a recommendation against ADT for pathologic lymph
node metastatic prostate cancer in the ASCO guidelines.604 In addition, a
cohort analysis of 731 patients with positive nodes did not demonstrate a
survival benefit of ADT initiated within 4 months of radical prostatectomy
compared to observation.603 At this time, the Panel recommends that
patients with lymph node metastases found at radical prostatectomy
should be considered for immediate ADT (category 1) with or without
EBRT (category 2B), but that observation is also an option for these
patients.

Palliative ADT

Palliative ADT can be given to patients with a life expectancy of less than
or equal to 5 years who have high-risk, very-high-risk, regional, or
metastatic prostate cancer. Palliative ADT also can be given to patients
with disease progression during observation, usually when symptoms
develop or when changes in PSA levels suggest that symptoms are
imminent. The options in this setting are orchiectomy, LHRH agonist, or
LHRH antagonist (category 2B for LHRH antagonist).

ADT for Castration-Naive Disease

The term “castration-naive" is used to define patients who have not been
treated with ADT and those who are not on ADT at the time of
progression. The NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel uses the term "castration-
naive" even when patients have had neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or
adjuvant ADT as part of RT provided they have recovered testicular
function. Options for patients with castration-naïve disease who require

ADT depend on the presence of distant metastases, and can be found in
full in the Guidelines algorithm above.

ADT for castration-naïve prostate cancer can be accomplished using
bilateral orchiectomy, an LHRH agonist or antagonist, or an LHRH agonist
plus a first-generation antiandrogen. As discussed below, abiraterone or
docetaxel can be added to orchiectomy, LHRH agonist, or LHRH
antagonist for M1 disease. For patients with M0 disease, observation is
preferred over ADT.

LHRH agonists and LHRH antagonists appear equally effective in patients
with advanced prostate cancer.605

Medical or surgical castration combined with an antiandrogen is known as
combined androgen blockade. No prospective randomized studies have
demonstrated a survival advantage with combined androgen blockade
over the serial use of an LHRH agonist and an antiandrogen.604 Meta-
analysis data suggest that bicalutamide may provide an incremental
relative improvement in OS by 5% to 20% over LHRH agonist
monotherapy.606,607 However, others have concluded that more complete
disruption of the androgen axis (with finasteride, dutasteride, or
antiandrogen added to medical or surgical castration) provides little if any
benefit over castration alone.608,609 Combined androgen blockade therapy
adds to cost and side effects, and prospective randomized evidence that
combined androgen blockade is more efficacious than ADT is lacking.

Antiandrogen monotherapy appears to be less effective than medical or
surgical castration and is not recommended for primary ADT. Furthermore,
dutasteride plus bicalutamide showed no benefit over bicalutamide alone
in patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.610

Recent evidence suggests that orchiectomy may be safer than an LHRH
agonist. Four hundred twenty-nine patients with metastatic prostate cancer

Prostate Cancer

who underwent orchiectomy were compared to 2866 patients who
received LHRH agonist between 1995 and 2009. Orchiectomy was
associated with lower risk of fracture, peripheral arterial disease, and
cardiac-related complications, although risk was similar for diabetes, deep
vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and cognitive disorders.611 Post-
hoc analysis of a randomized trial of LHRH antagonist versus LHRH
agonist found lower risk of cardiac events in patients with existing cardiac
disease treated with LHRH antagonist.612 The heart and T lymphocytes
have receptors for LHRH. Therefore, LHRH agonists may affect cardiac
contractility, vascular plaque stability, and inflammation.613

sustained suppression of testosterone (<50 ng/dL) can be considered, and
relugolix may not be a preferred agent if adherence is uncertain.

It is important to note that the HERO trial did not include patients receiving
curative intent therapy (ie, individuals getting definitive EBRT plus ADT).
Furthermore, relugolix shows a shorter time to testosterone recovery,
which might be associated with a higher risk of death from prostate
cancer.615 Therefore, although the Panel considers relugolix to be an
acceptable option in the curative-intent setting, additional studies in this
setting are needed.

A new LHRH antagonist, relugolix, has been studied as ADT in patients
with advanced prostate cancer in the randomized phase 3 HERO trial.614 In
this study, 622 patients received relugolix (120 mg orally once daily) and
308 received leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The
patients had recurrence after primary definitive therapy, newly diagnosed
metastatic castration-naïve disease, or advanced localized disease
deemed unlikely to be cured with definite therapy. The primary endpoint,
sustained castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng per deciliter) through 48
weeks, showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix over leuprolide
(96.7%; 95% CI, 94.9–97.9 vs. 88.8% [95% CI, 84.6–91.8]; P < .001 for
superiority). The secondary endpoint of castrate levels of testosterone on
day 4 was also improved in the relugolix arm (56% vs. 0%). However,
relugolix did not achieve superiority in the key clinical secondary endpoint
of castration resistance-free survival compared to leuprolide (74% vs.
75%; P = .84). The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was
2.9% in the relugolix arm and 6.2% in the leuprolide arm (HR, 0.46; 95%
CI, 0.24–0.88).  The Panel includes relugolix alone as an option for ADT in
patients with castration-naïve disease. However, the Panel notes that data
are limited on long-term adherence of oral relugolix and the potential
effects non-adherence may have on optimal ADT. Ongoing monitoring for

Patients should be queried about adverse effects related to ADT.
Intermittent ADT should be used for those who experience significant side
effects of ADT (see Intermittent Versus Continuous ADT, below).

ADT for M0 Biochemical Recurrence
Controversy remains about the timing and duration of ADT when disease
persists or recurs after local therapy. Many believe that early ADT is best,
but cancer control must be balanced against side effects. Early ADT is
associated with increased side effects and the potential development of
the metabolic syndrome.

Patients with an increasing PSA level and with no symptomatic or clinical
evidence of cancer after definitive treatment present a therapeutic
dilemma regarding the role of ADT. Some of these patients will ultimately
die of their cancer. Timing of ADT for patients whose only evidence of
cancer is increasing PSA is influenced by PSA velocity (PSADT), patient
and physician anxiety, the short-term and long-term side effects of ADT,
and underlying comorbidities of the patient. Early ADT is acceptable, but
an alternative is close observation until progression of cancer, at which
time appropriate therapeutic options may be considered. Earlier ADT may
be better than delayed therapy, although the definitions of early and late
(ie, what level of PSA) remain controversial. The multicenter phase 3

Prostate Cancer

TROG 03.06/VCOG PR 01-03 [TOAD] trial randomized 293 patients with
PSA relapse after operation or radiation (n = 261) or who were not
considered for curative treatment (n = 32) to immediate ADT or ADT
delayed by a recommended interval of greater than or equal to 2 years.616
Five-year OS was improved in the immediate therapy arm compared with
the delayed therapy arm (91.2% vs. 86.4%; log-rank P = .047). No
significant differences were seen in the secondary endpoint of global
health-related QOL at 2 years.617 In addition, there were no differences
over 5 years in global QOL, physical functioning, role or emotional
functioning, insomnia, fatigue, dyspnea, or feeling less masculine.
However, sexual activity was lower and the hormone treatment-related
symptoms score was higher in the immediate ADT group compared with
the delayed ADT group. Most clinical trials in this patient population
require PSA level ≥0.5 mg/dL (after radical prostatectomy) or “nadir + 2”
(after radiation) for enrollment.

The Panel believes that the benefit of early ADT is uncertain and must be
balanced against the risk of ADT side effects. Patients with an elevated
PSA and/or a shorter PSADT (rapid PSA velocity) and an otherwise long
life expectancy should be encouraged to consider ADT earlier. Patients
who opt for ADT should consider the intermittent approach. The timing of
ADT initiation should be individualized according to PSA velocity, patient
anxiety, and potential side effects. Patients with shorter PSADT or rapid
PSA velocity and long life expectancy may be encouraged to consider
early ADT. Patients with prolonged PSADTs who are older are excellent
candidates for observation.

Primary ADT for M1 Castration-Naïve Prostate Cancer
ADT with treatment intensification is preferred for most patients with
metastatic prostate cancer. ADT alone is appropriate for some patients.604
A PSA value ≤4 ng/mL after 7 months of ADT is associated with improved
survival of patients newly diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer.618

ADT options for M1 castration-naïve disease are:

•  Orchiectomy ± docetaxel
•  LHRH agonist alone ± docetaxel
•  LHRH agonist plus first-generation antiandrogen ± docetaxel
•  LHRH antagonist ± docetaxel
•  Orchiectomy plus abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide
•  LHRH agonist plus abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide
•  LHRH antagonist plus abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide

In patients with overt metastases in weight-bearing bone who are at risk of
developing symptoms associated with the flare in testosterone with initial
LHRH agonist alone, antiandrogen therapy should precede or be
coadministered with LHRH agonist for at least 7 days to diminish ligand
binding to the androgen receptor.619,620 LHRH antagonists rapidly and
directly inhibit the release of androgens, unlike LHRH agonists that initially
stimulate LHRH receptors prior to hypogonadism. Therefore, no initial flare
is associated with these agents and coadministration of antiandrogen is
unnecessary.

The data supporting the addition of abiraterone, apalutamide,
enzalutamide, or docetaxel to ADT in this setting are discussed below.
These are all category 1, preferred options; the fine-particle formulation of
abiraterone (discussed in Abiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC, below) can be
added to ADT as a category 2B option. ADT (LHRH agonist, LHRH
antagonist, or orchiectomy) with EBRT to the primary tumor for low-
volume metastatic disease is discussed in EBRT to the Primary Tumor in
Low-Volume M1 Disease, above.

Abiraterone Acetate in Castration-Naïve Prostate Cancer
In February 2018, the FDA approved abiraterone in combination with
prednisone for metastatic castration-naïve prostate cancer.621,622 This
approval was based on two randomized phase 3 clinical trials of

Prostate Cancer

abiraterone and low-dose prednisone plus ADT that were reported in
patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer or high-risk or
node-positive disease (STAMPEDE and LATITUDE) that demonstrated
improved OS over ADT alone.623 In LATITUDE, 1199 patients with high-
risk, metastatic, castration-naïve prostate cancer were randomized to
abiraterone with prednisone 5 mg once daily or matching placebos. High-
risk disease was defined as at least two of the following: Gleason score 8–
10, ≥3 bone metastases, and visceral metastases.623 Efficacy was
demonstrated at the first interim analysis, and the trial was unblinded. The
primary endpoint of OS was met and favored abiraterone (HR, 0.62; 95%
CI, 0.51–0.76; P < .0001). Estimated 3-year OS rates improved from 49%
to 66% at 30 months follow-up. Secondary endpoints were improved and
included delayed castration-resistant radiographic progression (from
median 14.8–33.2 months), PSA progression (7.4–33.2 months), time to
pain progression, and initiation of chemotherapy. After the first interim
analysis, 72 patients crossed over from placebo to abiraterone. Final OS
analysis of LATITUDE after a median follow-up of 51.8 months showed
median OS was significantly longer in the abiraterone group than in the
placebo group (53.3 months vs. 36.5 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56–
0.78; P < .0001).624

Adverse events were higher with abiraterone and prednisone but were
generally mild in nature and largely related to mineralocorticoid excess (ie,
hypertension, hypokalemia, edema), hormonal effects (ie, fatigue, hot
flushes), and liver toxicity.623 Cardiac events, such as atrial fibrillation, were
rare but slightly increased with abiraterone. The overall discontinuation
rate due to side effects was 12%. Patient-reported outcomes were
improved with the addition of abiraterone, with improvements in pain
intensity progression, fatigue, functional decline, prostate cancer-related
symptoms, and overall health-related QOL.625 A limitation of this trial is that
only 27% of placebo-treated patients received abiraterone or enzalutamide

at progression, and only 52% of these patients received any life-
prolonging therapy.623

A second randomized trial (STAMPEDE) of 1917 patients with castration-
naïve prostate cancer demonstrated similar OS benefits.423 However,
unlike LATITUDE, STAMPEDE eligibility permitted patients with high-risk
N0,M0 disease (2 of 3 high-risk factors: stage T3/4, PSA >40, or Gleason
score 8–10; n = 509), or N1,M0 disease (pelvic nodal metastases; n =
369) in addition to M1 patients, who made up the majority of patients (n =
941). The majority of patients were newly diagnosed, while a minority had
recurrent, high-risk, or metastatic disease after local therapy (n = 98).
Thus, STAMPEDE was a heterogeneous mix of patients with high-risk,
non-metastatic, node-positive, or M1 disease. In M1 patients, treatment
with abiraterone plus prednisone was continued until progression. In
patients with N1 or M0 disease, 2 years of abiraterone plus prednisolone
was used if curative-intent EBRT was utilized. OS was improved in the
overall population (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.5–0.76; P < .0001) and in the M1
and N1 subsets, without any heterogeneity of treatment effect by
metastatic status. The survival benefit of abiraterone was larger in patients
<70 years of age than those ≥70 years (HR, 0.94 vs. HR, 0.51). Patients
who were older also suffered increased toxicities, which suggests
heterogeneity in clinical benefits by age and comorbidity. The secondary
endpoint of FFS, which included PSA recurrence, was improved overall
(HR, 0.29; P < .0001) and in all subgroups regardless of M1 (HR, 0.31),
N1 (HR, 0.29), or M0 (HR, 0.21) status. No heterogeneity for FFS was
observed based on subgroups or by age. In this trial, subsequent life-
prolonging therapy was received by 58% of those in the control group,
which included 22% who received abiraterone and 26% who received
enzalutamide. Thus, these data reflect a survival advantage of initial
abiraterone in newly diagnosed patients compared with deferring therapy
to the CRPC setting.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Adverse events in STAMPEDE were similar to that reported in LATITUDE,
but were increased in patients who were older, with higher incidences of
grade 3–5 adverse events with abiraterone (47% vs. 33%) and 9 versus 3
treatment-related deaths. Severe hypertension or cardiac disorders were
noted in 10% of patients and grade 3–5 liver toxicity in 7%, which
illustrates the need for blood pressure and renal and hepatic function
monitoring.

Taken together, these data led the NCCN Panel to recommend
abiraterone with 5-mg once-daily prednisone as a treatment option with
ADT for patients with newly diagnosed, M1, castration-naïve prostate
cancer (category 1). Alternatively, the fine-particle formulation of
abiraterone can be used (category 2B; see Abiraterone Acetate in M1
CRPC, below). For patients undergoing curative-intent treatment for N1
disease, abiraterone can be added to EBRT with 2 to 3 years of
neoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT or can be given with ADT for
castration-naïve disease (without EBRT). The fine-particle formulation of
abiraterone is an option (category 2B; see Abiraterone Acetate in M1
CRPC, below). However, there was insufficient survival, FFS data, and
follow-up available to recommend abiraterone for patients with high-risk or
very-high-risk N0 M0 prostate cancer. Further follow-up and dedicated
ongoing clinical trials are needed in this curative-intent RT population.

Abiraterone can be given at 250 mg/day and administered following a low-
fat breakfast, as an alternative to the dose of 1000 mg/day after an
overnight fast (see Abiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC, below).626 The cost
savings may reduce financial toxicity and improve adherence.

Apalutamide in Castration-Naïve Prostate Cancer
The double-blind phase 3 TITAN clinical trial randomized 1052 patients
with metastatic, castration-naïve prostate cancer to ADT with apalutamide
(240 mg/day) or placebo.627 Participants were stratified by Gleason score
at diagnosis, geographic region, and previous docetaxel treatment. The

median follow-up was 22.7 months. Both primary endpoints were met:
radiographic PFS (68.2% vs. 47.5% at 24 months; HR for radiographic
progression or death, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39–0.60; P < .001) and OS (82.4%
vs. 73.5% at 24 months; HR for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.89; P = .005).
Adverse events that were more common with apalutamide than with
placebo included rash, hypothyroidism, and ischemic heart disease.
Health-related QOL was maintained during treatment.628 At final analysis of
TITAN, median OS was improved with apalutamide plus ADT compared
with ADT alone after a median follow-up of 44 months (NR vs. 52.2
months; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53–0.79; P < .001)629

Apalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration-naïve
prostate cancer. The FDA approved this indication in September of
2019.630,631

Enzalutamide in Castration-Naïve Prostate Cancer
The open-label randomized phase 3 ENZAMET clinical trial compared
enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus ADT (LHRH analog or surgical castration)
with a first-generation antiandrogen (bicalutamide, nilutamide, or
flutamide) plus ADT in 1125 patients with metastatic castration-naïve
prostate cancer.632 Stratification was by volume of disease, planned use of
early docetaxel, planned use of bone anti-resorptive therapy, comorbidity
score, and trial site. The primary endpoint of OS was met at the first
interim analysis with median follow-up of 34 months (HR for death, 0.67;
95% CI, 0.52–0.86; P = .002). Enzalutamide also improved secondary
endpoints, such as PFS using PSA levels and clinical PFS.

In the double-blind randomized phase 3 ARCHES clinical, 1150 patients
with metastatic castration-naïve prostate cancer were randomized to
receive ADT with either enzalutamide (160 mg/day) or placebo.
Participants were stratified by disease volume and prior docetaxel use.
The primary endpoint was radiographic PFS, which was improved in the

enzalutamide group after a median follow-up of 14.4 months (19.0 months
vs. not reached; HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30–0.50; P < .001).633

The safety of enzalutamide in these trials was similar to that seen in
previous trials in the castration-resistant setting. Adverse events
associated with enzalutamide in these trials included fatigue, seizures, and
hypertension.632,633

Enzalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration-naïve
prostate cancer.

Intermittent Versus Continuous ADT

ADT is associated with substantial side effects, which generally increase
with the duration of treatment. Intermittent ADT is an approach based on
the premise that cycles of androgen deprivation followed by re-exposure
may delay “androgen independence,” reduce treatment morbidity, and
improve QOL.634,635 Some patients who have no ADT-related morbidity
may find the uncertainty of intermittent ADT not worthwhile. Intermittent
ADT requires close monitoring of PSA and testosterone levels, especially
during off-treatment periods, and patients may need to switch to
continuous therapy upon signs of disease progression.

Intermittent ADT in Non-Metastatic Disease
The Canadian-led PR.7 trial was a phase 3 trial of intermittent versus
continuous ADT in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer who
experienced biochemical recurrence after primary or post-recurrence
EBRT.636 One thousand three hundred eighty-six patients with PSA >3
ng/mL were randomly assigned to intermittent ADT or continuous ADT. At
a median follow-up of 6.9 years, the intermittent approach was non-inferior
to continuous ADT with respect to OS (8.8 vs. 9.1 years, respectively; HR,
1.02; 95% CI, 0.86–1.21). More patients died from prostate cancer in the
intermittent ADT arm (120 of 690 patients) than in the continuous ADT arm
(94 of 696 patients), but this was balanced by more non-prostate cancer

deaths in the continuous ADT arm. Physical function, fatigue, urinary
problems, hot flashes, libido, and erectile dysfunction showed modest
improvement in the intermittent ADT group. The test population was
heterogenous, so it remains unclear which of these asymptomatic patients
benefitted from treatment. It is possible that many of these patients could
have delayed ADT without harm. The test population had a low disease
burden and 59% of deaths in the trial were not related to prostate cancer.
Follow-up longer than 6.9 years may be required for disease-specific
deaths to out-balance deaths by other causes.

An unplanned Cox regression analysis of the trial showed that patients
with Gleason sum greater than 7 in the continuous ADT arm had a median
survival (8 years) that was 14 months longer than those with the same
Gleason sum in the intermittent ADT arm (6.8 years).636 In this situation,
patients should be given the option to weigh the effects of ADT on QOL
against a possible impact on survival, although pathology was not centrally
reviewed and the study was not powered to detect small differences in
survival based on Gleason sum.637

The multinational European ICELAND trial randomized 702 participants
with locally advanced or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer to
continuous or intermittent ADT.638 Clinical outcomes, which included time
to PSA progression, PSA PFS, OS, mean PSA levels over time, QOL, and
adverse events, were similar between the arms.

A 2015 meta-analysis identified 6 randomized controlled trials comparing
continuous with intermittent ADT in patients with locally advanced prostate
cancer and found no difference in mortality and progression and an
advantage of the intermittent approach in terms of QOL and adverse
effects.639

Prostate Cancer

Intermittent ADT in Metastatic Disease
Hussain and colleagues640 conducted the SWOG (Southwest Oncology
Group) 9346 trial to compare intermittent and continuous ADT in patients
with metastatic disease. After 7 months of induction ADT, 1535 patients
whose PSA dropped to 4 ng/mL or below (thereby demonstrating
androgen sensitivity) were randomized to intermittent or continuous ADT.
At a median follow-up of 9.8 years, median survival was 5.1 years for the
intermittent ADT arm and 5.8 years for the continuous ADT arm. The HR
for death with intermittent ADT was 1.10 with a 90% CI between 0.99 and
1.23, which exceeded the prespecified upper boundary of 1.20 for non-
inferiority. The authors stated that the survival results were inconclusive,
and that a 20% greater mortality risk with the intermittent approach cannot
be ruled out. The study demonstrated better erectile function and mental
health in patients receiving intermittent ADT at 3 months, but the
difference became insignificant thereafter, most likely due to
contamination of assessments of those on the intermittent arm who may
have returned to ADT at the prespecified time points. A secondary
analysis of SWOG 9346 showed that intermittent ADT did not reduce
endocrine, bone, or cognitive events, whereas it increased the incidence
of ischemic and thrombotic events.641

In a post-hoc stratification analysis of the trial, patients with minimal
disease had a median survival of 5.4 years when receiving intermittent
ADT versus 6.9 years when receiving continuous ADT (HR, 1.19; 95% CI,
0.98–1.43).640 The median survival was 4.9 years in the intermittent ADT
arm compared to 4.4 years in the continuous ADT arm for patients with
extensive disease (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.85–1.22). These subgroup
analyses are hypothesis-generating.

A population-based analysis that included 9772 patients with advanced
prostate cancer aged greater than or equal to 66 years showed that
intermittent ADT reduced the risks of total serious cardiovascular events

by 36%, heart failure by 38%, and pathologic fracture by 48%, compared
with continuous ADT.642 Furthermore, several meta-analyses of
randomized controlled trials reported no difference in survival between
intermittent ADT and continuous ADT.643-645 Another recent analysis
concluded that the non-inferiority of intermittent to continuous ADT in
terms of survival has not been clearly demonstrated.646 Still, the
intermittent approach leads to marked improvement in QOL compared to
the continuous approach in most studies, and the Panel believes that
intermittent ADT should be strongly considered.

A more personalized approach could be to treat all patients with metastatic
disease with ADT. After 7 months of ADT, patients can be assigned a risk
category based on the PSA value at that time point618: low risk is defined
by a PSA less than 0.2 ng/mL (median survival of 75 months);
intermediate risk is defined by a PSA between 0.2 and 4.0 ng/mL (median
survival of 44 months), and high risk is defined by a PSA higher than 4.0
ng/mL (median survival of 13 months). Those patients who have few or no
symptoms related to ADT after 7 months of therapy will not benefit from
intermittent ADT in terms of QOL, and therefore continuous ADT is
reasonable because it is easier to administer.637 However, for those
patients with significant side effects impacting QOL, intermittent ADT
should be considered for those with low or intermediate risk after a
discussion about the impact on survival. A final consideration is based on
a subgroup analysis of S9346 that suggested that those who initially
present with pain have better survival on continuous therapy than
intermittent therapy.

Adverse Effects of Traditional ADT

ADT has a variety of adverse effects including hot flashes, vasomotor
instability, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, shrinkage of penis and
testicles, loss of muscle mass and strength, fatigue, anemia, breast
enlargement and tenderness/soreness, depression and mood swings, hair

Prostate Cancer

loss, osteoporosis, greater incidence of clinical fractures, obesity, insulin
resistance, alterations in lipids, and greater risk for diabetes, acute kidney
injury, and cardiovascular disease.647-649 The intensity and spectrum of
these side effects vary greatly. In general, the side effects of continuous
ADT increase with the duration of treatment. In addition, some forms of
ADT may result in lower risk than others. For example, relugolix was
associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events than
leuprolide in the phase 3 HERO study (also see ADT for Castration-Naïve
Disease, above), although the FDA considered these results in HERO to
be exploratory and therefore did not allow for these data to be included in
the prescribing information for relugolix.614 Overall, very limited prospective
head-to-head studies to date have evaluated the cardiovascular toxicity of
LHRH agonists versus LHRH antagonists as the primary endpoint.

Recent evidence suggests that a link between ADT and cognitive decline,
dementia, or future Alzheimer’s disease may exist, although data are
inconsistent, the risk is low, and the link remains to be proven.650-657

Patients and their medical providers should be advised about these risks
prior to treatment. Many side effects of ADT are reversible or can be
avoided or mitigated. For example, physical activity can counter many of
these symptoms and should be recommended (see NCCN Guidelines for
Survivorship, available at www.NCCN.org). Use of statins also should be
considered.

Bone Health During ADT
Medical or surgical ADT is associated with greater risk for osteoporosis
and clinical fractures. In large population-based studies, for example, ADT
was associated with a 21% to 54% relative increase in fracture risk.658-660
Longer treatment duration conferred greater fracture risk. Age and
comorbidity also were associated with higher fracture incidence. In a
population-based cohort of 3295 patients, surgical castration was
associated with a significantly lower risk of fractures than medical

castration using an LHRH agonist (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62–0.94;
P = .01).613 ADT increases bone turnover and decreases bone mineral
density,661-664 a surrogate for fracture risk in patients with non-metastatic
disease. Bone mineral density of the hip and spine decreases by
approximately 2% to 3% per year during initial therapy. Most studies have
reported that bone mineral density continues to decline steadily during
long-term therapy. ADT significantly decreases muscle mass,665 and
treatment-related sarcopenia appears to contribute to frailty and increased
risk of falls in patients who are older.

The NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends screening and treatment for
osteoporosis according to guidelines for the general population from the
National Osteoporosis Foundation.666 A baseline bone mineral density
study should be considered for the patients on ADT. The National
Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines include: 1) calcium (1000–1200 mg
daily from food and supplements) and vitamin D3 (400–1000 IU daily); and
2) additional treatment for males aged greater than or equal to 50 years
with low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5, osteopenia) at the
femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine by dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and a 10-year probability of hip fracture
greater than or equal to 3% or a 10-year probability of a major
osteoporosis-related fracture greater than or equal to 20%. Fracture risk
can be assessed using the algorithm FRAX®, recently released by
WHO.667 ADT should be considered “secondary osteoporosis” using the
FRAX® algorithm.

Earlier randomized controlled trials demonstrated that bisphosphonates
increase bone mineral density, a surrogate for fracture risk, during ADT.668-
670 In 2011, the FDA approved denosumab as a treatment to prevent bone
loss and fractures during ADT. Denosumab binds to and inhibits the
receptor activator of NF-B ligand (RANKL) to blunt osteoclast function
and delay generalized bone resorption and local bone destruction.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Approval was based on a phase 3 study that randomized 1468 patients
with non-metastatic prostate cancer undergoing ADT to either biannual
denosumab or placebo. At 24 months, denosumab increased bone
mineral density by 6.7% and reduced fractures (1.5% vs. 3.9%) compared
to placebo.671 Denosumab also was approved for prevention of SREs in
patients with bone metastasis (see Chemotherapy, Immunotherapy, and
Targeted Therapy).

Currently, treatment with denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), zoledronic
acid (5 mg IV annually), or alendronate (70 mg PO weekly) is
recommended when the absolute fracture risk warrants drug therapy. A
baseline DEXA scan before start of therapy and a follow-up DEXA scan
after one year of therapy is recommended by the International Society for
Clinical Densitometry to monitor response. Use of biochemical markers of
bone turnover is not recommended. There are no existing guidelines on
the optimal frequency of vitamin D testing, but vitamin D levels can be
measured when DEXA scans are obtained.

Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease
In a landmark population-based study, ADT was associated with higher
incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.672 After controlling for
other variables, which included age and comorbidity, ADT with an LHRH
agonist was associated with increased risk for new diabetes (HR, 1.44; P
< .001), coronary artery disease (HR, 1.16; P < .001), and myocardial
infarction (HR, 1.11; P = .03). Studies that evaluated the potential
relationship between ADT and cardiovascular mortality have produced
mixed results.584,672-679 In a Danish cohort of 31,571 patients with prostate
cancer, medical castration was associated with an increased risk for
myocardial infarction (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16–1.49) and stroke (HR, 1.19;
95% CI, 1.06–1.35) whereas surgical castration was not.680 Other
population-based studies resulted in similar findings.613,681 However, a
Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database analysis found no

difference in ischemic events with LHRH agonist therapy or
orchiectomy.682 A French database study showed the cardiovascular risk
to be similar in patients taking LHRH agonists and antagonists.683
However, some data suggest that LHRH antagonists might be associated
with a lower risk of cardiac events within 1 year in patients with preexisting
cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial ischemia, coronary artery
disease, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, angina pectoris,
or coronary artery bypass) compared with agonists.612 Patients with a
recent history of cardiovascular disease appear to have higher risk,684 and
increased physical activity may decrease the symptoms and
cardiovascular side effects of patients treated with ADT.685

Several mechanisms may contribute to greater risk for diabetes and
cardiovascular disease during ADT. ADT increases fat mass and
decreases lean body mass.665,686,687 ADT with an LHRH agonist increases
fasting plasma insulin levels688,689 and decreases insulin sensitivity.690 ADT
also increases serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.688,691

ADT may also prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider
whether the benefits of ADT outweigh the potential risks in patients with
congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and frequent
electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong
the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected, and
periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be
considered.

Cardiovascular disease and diabetes are leading causes of morbidity and
mortality in the general population. Based on the observed adverse
metabolic effects of ADT and the association between ADT and higher
incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, screening for and
intervention to prevent/treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease are
recommended for patients receiving ADT. Whether strategies for
screening, prevention, and treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular

Prostate Cancer

disease in patients receiving ADT should differ from those of the general
population remains uncertain.

Management of Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate
Cancer

ADT with treatment intensification is strongly recommended for patients
with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. The use of ADT
monotherapy in this setting is discouraged unless there are clear
contraindications to combination therapy. Treatment intensification options
include doublet therapy of ADT with abiraterone, apalutamide, or
enzalutamide; triplet therapy of ADT with docetaxel and abiraterone or
darolutamide; or ADT with EBRT to the primary tumor for low-metastatic
burden. The data supporting doublet or triplet therapy in this setting are
discussed below. The doublet and triplet therapies are all category 1,
preferred options; the fine-particle formulation of abiraterone (discussed in
Abiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC, below) can be added to ADT as a
category 2B, other recommended option. ADT with EBRT to the primary
tumor for patients with low metastatic burden is discussed in EBRT to the
Primary Tumor in Low-Metastatic-Burden M1 Disease, above.

Doublet Therapies for Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer

Abiraterone Acetate in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
In February 2018, the FDA approved abiraterone in combination with
prednisone for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. This
approval was based on two randomized phase 3 clinical trials of
abiraterone and low-dose prednisone plus ADT in patients with newly
diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer or high-risk or node-positive disease
(STAMPEDE and LATITUDE) that demonstrated improved OS over ADT
alone.623

In LATITUDE, 1199 patients with high-risk, metastatic, castration-sensitive
prostate cancer were randomized to abiraterone with prednisone 5 mg

once daily or matching placebos. High-risk disease was defined as at least
two of the following: Gleason score 8–10, ≥3 bone metastases, and
visceral metastases.623 Efficacy was demonstrated at the first interim
analysis, and the trial was unblinded. The primary endpoint of OS was met
and favored abiraterone (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51–0.76; P < .0001).
Estimated 3-year OS rates improved from 49% to 66% at 30 months
follow-up. Secondary endpoints were improved and included delayed
castration-resistant radiographic progression (from median 14.8–33.2
months), PSA progression (7.4–33.2 months), time to pain progression,
and initiation of chemotherapy. After the first interim analysis, 72 patients
crossed over from placebo to abiraterone. Final OS analysis of LATITUDE
after a median follow-up of 51.8 months showed median OS was
significantly longer in the abiraterone group than in the placebo group
(53.3 months vs. 36.5 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56–0.78; P < .0001).624

Adverse events were higher with abiraterone and prednisone but were
generally mild in nature and largely related to mineralocorticoid excess (ie,
hypertension, hypokalemia, edema), hormonal effects (ie, fatigue, hot
flushes), and liver toxicity.623 Cardiac events, such as atrial fibrillation, were
rare but slightly increased with abiraterone. The overall discontinuation
rate due to side effects was 12%. Patient-reported outcomes were
improved with the addition of abiraterone, with improvements in pain
intensity progression, fatigue, functional decline, prostate cancer-related
symptoms, and overall health-related QOL.625 A limitation of this trial is that
only 27% of placebo-treated patients received abiraterone or enzalutamide
at progression, and only 52% of these patients received any life-
prolonging therapy.623

The second randomized trial (STAMPEDE) of 1917 patients with
castration-sensitive prostate cancer demonstrated similar OS benefits.423
However, unlike LATITUDE, STAMPEDE eligibility permitted patients with
high-risk N0,M0 disease (2 of 3 high-risk factors: stage T3/4, PSA >40, or

Prostate Cancer

Gleason score 8–10; n = 509), or N1,M0 disease (pelvic nodal
metastases; n = 369) in addition to M1 patients, who made up the majority
of patients (n = 941). The majority of patients were newly diagnosed, while
a minority had recurrent, high-risk, or metastatic disease after local
therapy (n = 98). Thus, STAMPEDE was a heterogeneous mix of patients
with high-risk, non-metastatic, node-positive, or M1 disease. In M1
patients, treatment with abiraterone plus prednisone was continued until
progression. In patients with N1 or M0 disease, 2 years of abiraterone plus
prednisolone was used if curative-intent EBRT was utilized. OS was
improved in the overall population (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.5–0.76; P < .0001)
and in the M1 and N1 subsets, without any heterogeneity of treatment
effect by metastatic status. The survival benefit of abiraterone was larger
in patients <70 years of age than those ≥70 years (HR, 0.94 vs. HR, 0.51).
Patients ≥70 years also suffered increased toxicities, which suggests
heterogeneity in clinical benefits by age and comorbidity. The secondary
endpoint of FFS, which included PSA recurrence, was improved overall
(HR, 0.29; P < .0001) and in all subgroups regardless of M1 (HR, 0.31),
N1 (HR, 0.29), or M0 (HR, 0.21) status. No heterogeneity for FFS was
observed based on subgroups or by age. In this trial, subsequent life-
prolonging therapy was received by 58% of those in the control group,
which included 22% who received abiraterone and 26% who received
enzalutamide. Thus, these data reflect a survival advantage of initial
abiraterone in newly diagnosed patients compared with deferring therapy
to the CRPC setting.

Adverse events in STAMPEDE were similar to that reported in LATITUDE,
but were increased in patients ≥70 years, with higher incidences of grade
3–5 adverse events with abiraterone (47% vs. 33%) and 9 versus 3
treatment-related deaths. Severe hypertension or cardiac disorders were
noted in 10% of patients and grade 3–5 liver toxicity in 7%, which
illustrates the need for blood pressure and renal and hepatic function
monitoring.

Taken together, these data led the NCCN Panel to recommend
abiraterone with 5-mg once-daily prednisone as a treatment option with
ADT for patients with newly diagnosed, M1, castration-sensitive prostate
cancer (category 1). Alternatively, the fine-particle formulation of
abiraterone can be used (category 2B; see Abiraterone Acetate in M1
CRPC, below).

Abiraterone can be given at 250 mg/day and administered following a low-
fat breakfast as an alternative to the dose of 1000 mg/day after an
overnight fast (see Abiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC, below).626 The cost
savings may reduce financial toxicity and improve adherence.

Apalutamide in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
The double-blind phase 3 TITAN clinical trial randomized 1052 patients
with metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer to ADT with
apalutamide (240 mg/day) or placebo.627 Participants were stratified by
Gleason score at diagnosis, geographic region, and previous docetaxel
treatment. The median follow-up was 22.7 months. Both primary endpoints
were met: radiographic PFS (68.2% vs. 47.5% at 24 months; HR for
radiographic progression or death, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39–0.60; P < .001) and
OS (82.4% vs. 73.5% at 24 months; HR for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–
0.89; P = .005). Adverse events that were more common with apalutamide
than with placebo included rash, hypothyroidism, and ischemic heart
disease. Health-related QOL was maintained during treatment.628 At final
analysis of TITAN, median OS was improved with apalutamide plus ADT
compared with ADT alone after a median follow-up of 44 months (NR vs.
52.2 months; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53–0.79; P < .001)629

Apalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration-
sensitive prostate cancer. The FDA approved this indication in September
2019.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Enzalutamide in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
The open-label randomized phase 3 ENZAMET clinical trial compared
enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus ADT (LHRH analog or surgical castration)
with a first-generation antiandrogen (bicalutamide, nilutamide, or
flutamide) plus ADT in 1125 patients with metastatic castration-sensitive
prostate cancer.632 Stratification was by volume of disease, planned use of
early docetaxel, planned use of bone antiresorptive therapy, comorbidity
score, and trial site. The primary endpoint of OS was met at the first
interim analysis with median follow-up of 34 months (HR for death, 0.67;
95% CI, 0.52–0.86; P = .002). Enzalutamide also improved secondary
endpoints, such as PFS using PSA levels and clinical PFS. An additional
analysis was triggered at 470 deaths.692 After a median follow-up of 68
months, the 5-year OS rate was again lower in the first-generation
antiandrogen group than in the enzalutamide group (HR, 0.70; 95% CI,
0.58–0.84; P < .0001). The median OS was not reached.

In the double-blind randomized phase 3 ARCHES clinical, 1150 patients
with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer were randomized to
receive ADT with either enzalutamide (160 mg/day) or placebo.
Participants were stratified by disease volume and prior docetaxel use.
The primary endpoint was radiographic PFS, which was improved in the
enzalutamide group after a median follow-up of 14.4 months (19.0 months
vs. not reached; HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30–0.50; P < .001).633 At the final,
prespecified OS analysis, median OS was not met in either group, but a
34% reduction in the risk of death was observed in those receiving
enzalutamide versus placebo (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53–0.81; P < .001).693
This result could be an underestimate of the effect of enzalutamide, since
approximately 32% of the patients assigned placebo crossed over to
enzalutamide after unblinding.

The safety of enzalutamide in these trials was similar to that seen in
previous trials in the castration-resistant setting. Adverse events

associated with enzalutamide in these trials included fatigue, seizures, and
hypertension.632,633

Enzalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration-
sensitive prostate cancer. The FDA approved this indication in December
2019.

Docetaxel in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
Docetaxel has been studied as an upfront option for patients with
castration-sensitive prostate cancer and distant metastases based on
results from two phase 3 trials (ECOG 3805/CHAARTED and
STAMPEDE).422,694 CHAARTED randomized 790 patients with metastatic,
castration-sensitive prostate cancer to docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV q3 weeks x
6 doses) plus ADT or ADT alone.694 After a median follow-up of 53.7
months, the patients in the combination arm experienced a longer OS than
those in the ADT arm (57.6 months vs. 47.2 months; HR, 0.72; 95% CI,
0.59–0.89; P = .002).695 Subgroup analysis showed that the survival
benefit was more pronounced in the 65% of participants with high-volume
disease (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50–0.79; P < .001). Patients with low
metastatic burden in CHAARTED did not derive a survival benefit from the
inclusion of docetaxel (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.70–1.55; P = .86).

The STAMPEDE trial, a multi-arm, multi-stage phase 3 trial, included
patients with both M0 and M1 castration-sensitive prostate cancer.422 The
results in the M1 population confirmed the survival advantage of adding
docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV q3 weeks x 6 doses) to ADT seen in the
CHAARTED trial. In STAMPEDE, extent of disease was not evaluated in
the 1087 patients with metastatic disease, but the median OS for all
patients with M1 disease was 5.4 years in the ADT-plus-docetaxel arm
versus 3.6 years in the ADT-only arm (a difference of 1.8 years between
groups compared with a 1.1-year difference in CHAARTED).

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Patients with low metastatic burden did not have definitively improved
survival outcomes in the ECOG CHAARTED study or a similar European
trial (GETUG-AFU 15).694,696,697 Furthermore, the triplet options of ADT with
docetaxel and either abiraterone or darolutamide showed improved OS
over ADT with docetaxel (see below). The panel therefore does not
include docetaxel with ADT as an option for patients with metastatic
castration-sensitive prostate cancer. Rather, patients with high-volume
castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer who are fit for
chemotherapy should be considered for triplet therapy.

Triplet Therapies for Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer

Data from the PEACE-1 and ARASENS trials indicate that triplet therapies
of ADT with docetaxel and a novel hormone therapy—either abiraterone or
darolutamide—improve OS over ADT with docetaxel.698,699 These trials are
discussed below. Both of these combinations are included as category 1,
preferred options for patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate
cancer, and their use is encouraged for patients with high-volume de novo
disease who are fit for chemotherapy.

Docetaxel Plus Abiraterone in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
PEACE-1 was an international, open-label, randomized, phase 3 study
conducted in seven European countries.698 Using a 2 × 2 factorial design,
1173 patients with de novo metastatic prostate cancer were randomized at
a 1:1:1:1 ratio to standard of care (ADT alone or with docetaxel), standard
of care with RT, standard of care with abiraterone, or standard of care with
radiation and abiraterone. The two primary endpoints of the trial were
radiographic PFS and OS. Adjusted Cox regression modelling showed no
interaction between abiraterone and RT, so data were pooled for the
analysis of abiraterone efficacy. Consistent with results of older studies,
radiographic PFS was longer in patients who received abiraterone than in
those that did not (HR, 0.54; 99.9% CI, 0.41–0.71; P < .0001) as was OS
(HR, 082; 95.1% CI, 0.69–0.98; P = .030).

As part of the analysis, the efficacy of abiraterone was assessed in the
population that received docetaxel. As in the overall population,
radiographic PFS (HR, 0.50; 99.9% CI, 0.34–0.71; P < .0001) and OS
(HR, 0.75; 95.1% CI, 0.59–0.95; P = .017) were longer in those receiving
all three therapies compared with those only receiving ADT and docetaxel.
The populations receiving the triplet and doublet therapies experienced
similar rates neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and neuropathy,
although grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 63% of patients who
received the triplet combination compared with 52% of those receiving
ADT and docetaxel.

Docetaxel Plus Darolutamide in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
The international, phase 3 trial ARASENS trial, the second phase 3 trial
evaluating a triplet therapy, randomized 1306 patients with metastatic
castration-sensitive prostate cancer to receive ADT and docetaxel with
either darolutamide or matching placebo.699 The primary endpoint, OS,
was improved in the darolutamide group at 4 years (62.7%; 95% CI, 58.7–
66.7) compared with the placebo group (50.4%; 95% CI, 46.3–54.6). The
risk of death was lower in the darolutamide group by about 32% (HR, 0.68;
95% CI, 0.57–0.80; P < .001). The addition of darolutamide also showed
significant benefits over placebo for secondary efficacy endpoints,
including time to CRPC (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.30–0.42; P < .001), skeletal
event–free survival (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52–0.72; P < .001), and time to
initiation of subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy (HR, 0.39; 95%
CI, 0.33–0.46; P < .001).

Adverse events of any grade, grade 3 to 5 adverse events, and serious
adverse events occurred at similar incidence levels between the two arms.
Many of these were known effects of docetaxel. The most frequent
adverse events were alopecia (40.5% of patients in the darolutamide arm
vs. 40.6% with placebo), neutropenia (39.3% vs. 38.8%), fatigue (33.1%
vs. 32.9%), and anemia (27.8% vs 25.1%). Exceptions were rash (16.6%

vs. 13.5%) and hypertension (13.7% vs. 9.2%), which are known effects of
androgen receptor pathway inhibitors and were more frequent in the
darolutamide group.

The FDA approved this indication in August 2022.

Progression to and Management of CRPC

Most advanced disease eventually stops responding to traditional ADT
and is categorized as castration-resistant (also known as castration-
recurrent). CRPC is prostate cancer that progresses clinically,
radiographically, or biochemically despite castrate levels of serum
testosterone (<50 ng/dL).700 Patients whose disease progresses to CRPC
during primary ADT should receive a laboratory assessment to assure a
castrate level of testosterone (<50 ng/dL; <1.7 nmol/L). Imaging tests may
be indicated to monitor for signs of distant metastases. Factors affecting
the frequency of imaging include individual risk, age, overall patient health,
PSA velocity, and Gleason grade.

For patients who develop CRPC, ADT with an LHRH agonist or antagonist
should be continued to maintain castrate serum levels of testosterone
(<50 ng/dL).

Patients with CRPC and no signs of distant metastasis on conventional
imaging studies (M0) can consider monitoring with continued ADT if
PSADT is greater than 10 months (preferred), because these patients will
have a relatively indolent disease history.701 Secondary hormone therapy
with continued ADT is an option mainly for patients with shorter PSADT
(≤10 months) as described below.

For patients who develop metastatic CRPC, metastatic lesion biopsy is
recommended, as is MSI/MMR testing, if not previously performed. If MSI-
H or dMMR is found, referral to genetic counseling should be made to
assess for the possibility of Lynch syndrome. These patients should also

have germline and tumor testing to check for mutations in homologous
recombination repair (HRR) genes (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2,
FANCA, RAD51D, CHEK2, CDK12) if not done previously.702 This
information may be used for genetic counseling, early use of platinum
chemotherapy, or understanding eligibility for biomarker-directed
treatments or clinical trials. TMB testing should also be considered for
patients with metastatic CRPC to inform possible use of pembrolizumab in
later lines of therapy (see Pembrolizumab, below).

ADT is continued in patients with metastatic CRPC while additional
therapies, including secondary hormone therapies, chemotherapies,
immunotherapies, radiopharmaceuticals, and/or targeted therapies, are
sequentially applied, as discussed in the sections that follow; all patients
should receive best supportive care. The Panel defined treatment options
for patients with metastatic CRPC based on previous exposure to
docetaxel and to a novel hormone therapy. Novel hormone therapies
include abiraterone, enzalutamide, darolutamide, or apalutamide.
Abiraterone given as part of neoadjuvant/concomitant/adjuvant ADT with
EBRT is not considered prior novel hormonal therapy.

The decision to initiate therapy in the CRPC setting after disease
progression on one or more treatments should be based on the available
high-level evidence of safety, efficacy, and tolerability of these agents and
the application of this evidence to an individual patient. Prior exposures to
therapeutic agents should be considered. Data to inform the optimal
sequence for delivery of these agents in patients with metastatic CRPC is
limited (see Sequencing of Therapy in CRPC, below). Choice of therapy is
based largely on clinical considerations, which include patient preferences,
prior treatment, presence or absence of visceral disease, symptoms, and
potential side effects.

NCCN recommends that patients being treated for CRPC be closely
monitored with radiologic imaging (ie, CT, bone imaging), PSA tests, and

clinical exams for evidence of progression. Therapy should be continued
until clinical progression or intolerability, with consideration of the fact that
even in cases where PSA remains undetectable, bone imaging may reveal
progression.703,704 The sequential use of these agents is reasonable in a
patient who remains a candidate for further systemic therapy. Clinical trial
and best supportive care are additional options.

Secondary Hormone Therapy for CRPC

Research has shown enhancement of autocrine and/or paracrine
androgen synthesis in the tumor microenvironment of patients receiving
ADT.705,706 Androgen signaling consequent to non-gonadal sources of
androgen in CRPC refutes earlier beliefs that CRPC was resistant to
further hormone therapies. The development of novel hormonal agents
demonstrating efficacy in the non-metastatic and metastatic CRPC setting
dramatically changed the paradigm of CRPC treatment.

Abiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC

In April 2011, the FDA approved the androgen synthesis inhibitor,
abiraterone, in combination with low-dose prednisone, for the treatment of
patients with metastatic CRPC who have received prior chemotherapy
containing docetaxel.

FDA approval in the post-docetaxel, metastatic CRPC setting was based
on the results of a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (COU-AA-
301) in patients with metastatic CRPC previously treated with docetaxel-
containing regimens.707,708 Patients were randomized to receive either
abiraterone 1000 mg orally once daily (n = 797) or placebo once daily (n =
398), and both arms received daily prednisone. In the final analysis,
median survival was 15.8 versus 11.2 months in the abiraterone and
placebo arm, respectively (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64–0.86; P < .0001).708
Time to radiographic progression, PSA decline, and pain palliation also
were improved by abiraterone.708,709

FDA approval in the pre-docetaxel setting occurred in December 2012,
and was based on the randomized phase 3 COU-AA-302 trial of
abiraterone and prednisone (n = 546) versus prednisone alone (n = 542)
in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, metastatic
CRPC.710 Most participants in this trial were not taking narcotics for cancer
pain and none had visceral metastatic disease or prior ketoconazole
exposure. The coprimary endpoint of radiographic PFS was improved by
treatment from 8.3 to 16.5 months (HR, 0.53; P < .001). OS was improved
at final analysis with a median follow-up of 49.2 months (34.7 months vs.
30.3 months; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.93; P = .003).711 Key secondary
endpoints of time to symptomatic deterioration, time to chemotherapy
initiation, time to pain progression, and PSA PFS improved significantly
with abiraterone treatment; PSA declines (62% vs. 24% with >50%
decline) and radiographic responses (36% vs. 16% RECIST responses)
were more common.

The most common adverse reactions with abiraterone/prednisone (>5%)
were fatigue (39%); back or joint discomfort (28%–32%); peripheral
edema (28%); diarrhea, nausea, or constipation (22%); hypokalemia
(17%); hypophosphatemia (24%); atrial fibrillation (4%); muscle discomfort
(14%); hot flushes (22%); urinary tract infection; cough; hypertension
(22%, severe hypertension in 4%); urinary frequency and nocturia;
dyspepsia; or upper respiratory tract infection. The most common adverse
drug reactions that resulted in drug discontinuation were increased
aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase (11%–12%),
or cardiac disorders (19%, serious in 6%).

In May 2018, the FDA approved a novel, fine-particle formulation of
abiraterone, in combination with methylprednisolone, for the treatment of
patients with metastatic CRPC. In studies of healthy males, this
formulation at 500 mg was shown to be bioequivalent to 1000 mg of the
originator formulation.712,713 In a phase 2 therapeutic equivalence study, 53

Prostate Cancer

patients with metastatic CRPC who were not treated previously with
abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223, or chemotherapy (docetaxel for
metastatic CRPC completed ≥1 year prior to enrollment was allowed) were
randomized to 500 mg daily of the new, fine-particle formulation plus 4 mg
methylprednisolone orally twice daily or to 1000 mg of the originator
formulation daily plus 5 mg prednisone orally twice daily.714 Bioequivalence
of these doses was confirmed based on serum testosterone levels, PSA
response, and abiraterone pharmacokinetics. The rates of total and grade
3/4 adverse events were similar between the arms, with musculoskeletal
and connective tissue disorders occurring more frequently in the
originator-treated patients (37.9% vs. 12.5%). The Panel believes that the
fine-particle formulation of abiraterone can be used instead of the original
formulation of abiraterone in the treatment of patients with metastatic
CRPC (category 2A).

Based on the studies described here, abiraterone is a category 1,
preferred option for metastatic CRPC without prior novel hormone therapy.
For patients with metastatic CRPC and prior novel hormone therapy,
abiraterone is included in the other recommended regimens category. The
fine-particle formulation of abiraterone is included under other
recommended options in all metastatic CRPC settings.

A randomized phase 2 non-inferiority study of 75 patients with M1 CRPC
compared 1000 mg/day abiraterone after an overnight fast with 250
mg/day after a low-fat breakfast.626 The primary endpoint was log change
in PSA, with secondary endpoints of PSA response (≥50%) and PFS. The
primary endpoint favored the low-dose arm (log change in PSA, -1.59 vs. -
1.19), as did the PSA response rate (58% vs. 50%), with an equal PFS of
9 months in both arms. Noninferiority of the low dose was established
according to the predefined criteria. Therefore, abiraterone can be given at
250 mg/day administered following a low-fat breakfast, as an alternative to
the dose of 1000 mg/day after an overnight fast in patients who will not
take or cannot afford the standard dose. The cost savings may reduce
financial toxicity and improve adherence. Food impacts absorption
unpredictably; side effects should be monitored and standard dosing
(1000 mg on empty stomach) utilized if excess toxicity is observed on
modified dosing (250 mg with food).

Abiraterone with Dexamethasone in M1 CRPC
Switching from prednisone to dexamethasone 1 mg/day can be
considered for patients with M1 CRPC with disease progression on either
formulation of abiraterone. Trials show improved PSA responses and PFS
and acceptable safety using this strategy.

Abiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid (either oral
prednisone 5 mg twice daily or oral methylprednisolone 4 mg twice daily,
depending on which formulation is given) to abrogate signs of
mineralocorticoid excess that can result from treatment. These signs
include hypertension, hypokalemia, and peripheral edema. Thus,
monitoring of liver function, potassium and phosphate levels, and blood
pressure readings on a monthly basis is warranted during abiraterone
therapy. Symptom-directed assessment for cardiac disease also is
warranted, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

The SWITCH study was a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study of this
approach with 26 enrolled patients.715 The primary endpoint, the proportion
of patients with a PSA decline ≥30% in 6 weeks, was 46.2%. No
significant toxicities were observed, and two radiologic responses were
seen. In another study, 48 consecutive patients with metastatic CRPC,
with disease progression on abiraterone with prednisone, were switched to
abiraterone with 0.5 mg/day dexamethasone.716 The primary endpoint of
median PFS was 10.35 months, and PSA levels decreased or stabilized in
56% of patients after switching to dexamethasone.

Enzalutamide in M0 and M1 CRPC

In August 2012, the FDA approved enzalutamide, a next-generation
antiandrogen, for treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC who had
received prior docetaxel chemotherapy. Approval was based on the
results of the randomized, phase 3, placebo-controlled AFFIRM trial.717,718
AFFIRM randomized 1199 patients to enzalutamide or placebo in a 2:1
ratio and the primary endpoint was OS. Median survival was improved
with enzalutamide from 13.6 to 18.4 months (HR, 0.63; P < .001). Survival
was improved in all subgroups analyzed. Secondary endpoints also were
improved significantly, which included the proportion of patients with >50%
PSA decline (54% vs. 2%), radiographic response (29% vs. 4%),
radiographic PFS (8.3 vs. 2.9 months), and time to first SRE (16.7 vs. 13.3
months). QOL measured using validated surveys was improved with
enzalutamide compared to placebo. Adverse events were mild, and
included fatigue (34% vs. 29%), diarrhea (21% vs. 18%), hot flushes (20%
vs. 10%), headache (12% vs. 6%), and seizures (0.6% vs. 0%). The
incidence of cardiac disorders did not differ between the arms.
Enzalutamide is dosed at 160 mg daily. Patients in the AFFIRM study
were maintained on LHRH agonist/antagonist therapy and could receive
bone supportive care medications. The seizure risk in the enzalutamide
FDA label was 0.9% versus 0.6% in the manuscript.717,719

Another phase 3 trial studied enzalutamide in the pre-chemotherapy
setting. The PREVAIL study randomly assigned 1717 patients with
chemotherapy-naïve metastatic prostate cancer to daily enzalutamide or
placebo.720,721 The study was stopped early due to benefits shown in the
treatment arm. Compared to the placebo group, the enzalutamide group
showed improved median PFS (20.0 months vs. 5.4 months) and median
OS (35.3 months vs. 31.3 months). Improvements in all secondary
endpoints were also observed (eg, the time until chemotherapy initiation or
first SRE).

Two randomized clinical trials have reported that enzalutamide may be
superior to bicalutamide for cancer control in metastatic CRPC. The
TERRAIN study randomized 375 patients with treatment-naïve, metastatic
CRPC to 160 mg/day enzalutamide or 50 mg/day bicalutamide in a 1:1
manner.722 The enzalutamide group had significantly better PFS (defined
as PSA progression, soft tissue progression, or development of additional
bony metastases) compared to the bicalutamide group (median time to
progression, 15.7 vs. 5.8 months; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.34–0.57).

The STRIVE trial randomized 396 patients with M0 or M1 treatment-naïve
CRPC to 160 mg/day enzalutamide or 50 mg/day bicalutamide in a 1:1
manner.723 The primary endpoint in this study was PFS, defined as either
PSA progression, radiographic progression of disease, or death from any
cause. Enzalutamide reduced the risk of progression or death by 76%
compared to bicalutamide (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.18–0.32). These studies
demonstrated that enzalutamide extended PFS better than bicalutamide in
patients choosing an antiandrogen for secondary hormonal therapy
treatment of CRPC. Bicalutamide can still be considered in some patients,
given the different side-effect profiles of the agents and the increased cost
of enzalutamide.

Thus, enzalutamide represents a category 1, preferred treatment option
for patients without prior novel hormone therapy in the metastatic CRPC
setting. For patients with metastatic CRPC and prior novel hormone
therapy, enzalutamide is included in the other recommended regimens
group of options.

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 PROSPER trial
assessed the use of enzalutamide in 1401 patients with non-metastatic
CRPC.724 Patients with PSADT less than or equal to 10 months were
stratified according to PSADT (<6 months vs. ≥6 months) and use of bone-
sparing agents and randomized 2:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus
ADT or placebo plus ADT. Enzalutamide improved the primary endpoint of

Prostate Cancer

metastasis-free survival over placebo (36.6 months vs. 14.7 months; HR
for metastasis or death, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.24–0.35; P < .0001). Median OS
was longer in the enzalutamide group than in the placebo group (67.0
months vs. 56.3 months; HR for death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.89; P =
0.001).725 Adverse events included fatigue (33% vs. 14%), hypertension
(12% vs. 5%), major adverse cardiovascular events (5% vs. 3%), and
mental impairment disorders (5% vs. 2%). Patient-reported outcomes from
PROSPER indicate that enzalutamide delayed pain progression, symptom
worsening, and decrease in functional status, compared with placebo.726

After a median follow-up of 52 months, final OS analysis showed that
participants in SPARTAN experienced an improved median OS with
apalutamide versus placebo (73.9 months vs. 59.9 months; HR, 0.78; 95%
CI, 0.64–0.96; P = .016).729 This longer OS reached prespecified statistical
significance, even though 19% of participants crossed over from placebo
to apalutamide.

Apalutamide is a category 1, preferred option for patients with M0 CRPC if
PSADT is less than or equal to 10 months.

The FDA expanded approval for enzalutamide to include patients with
non-metastatic CRPC in July 2018, and the Panel believes that patients
with M0 CRPC can be offered enzalutamide, if PSADT is less than or
equal to 10 months (category 1, preferred option).

Patients receiving enzalutamide have no restrictions for food intake and
concurrent prednisone is permitted but not required.717

Apalutamide in M0 CRPC

The FDA approved apalutamide for treatment of patients with non-
metastatic CRPC in February 2018. This approval was based on the
phase 3 SPARTAN trial of 1207 patients with M0 CRPC and PSADT less
than or equal to 10 months.727 Participants were stratified according to
PSADT (>6 months vs. ≤6 months), use of bone-sparing agents, and the
presence of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes (N0 vs. N1). After a median
follow-up of 20.3 months, apalutamide at 240 mg/day with ADT improved
the primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival over placebo with ADT
(40.5 months vs. 16.2 months; HR for metastasis or death, 0.28; 95% CI,
0.23–0.35; P < .001). Adverse events included rash (24% vs. 5.5%),
fracture (11% vs. 6.5%), and hypothyroidism (8% vs. 2%). In a
prespecified exploratory analysis of SPARTAN, health-related QOL was
maintained in both the apalutamide and placebo groups.728

Darolutamide in M0 CRPC

The FDA approved darolutamide for treatment of patients with non-
metastatic CRPC in July 2019. The phase 3 ARAMIS study randomized
1509 patients with M0 CRPC and PSADT less than or equal to 10 months
2:1 to darolutamide (600 mg twice daily) or placebo.730 Participants were
stratified according to PSADT (>6 months vs. ≤6 months) and the use of
osteoclast-targeted agents. The median follow-up time was 17.9 months.
Darolutamide improved the primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival
compared to placebo (40.4 months vs. 18.4 months; HR for metastasis or
death, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.34–0.50; P < .001).

Patients in the placebo group of ARAMIS crossed over to darolutamide (n
= 170) or received other life-prolonging therapy (n = 137). Final analysis
occurred after a median follow-up time of 29.0 months. The risk of death
was 31% lower in the darolutamide group than in the placebo group (HR
for death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53–0.88; P = .003).731 OS at 3 years was 83%
(95% CI, 80–86) in the darolutamide group compared with 77% (95% CI,
72–81) in the placebo group. Adverse events that occurred more
frequently in the treatment arm included fatigue (12.1% vs. 8.7%), pain in
an extremity (5.8% vs. 3.2%), and rash (2.9% vs. 0.9%). The incidence of
fractures was similar between darolutamide and placebo (4.2% vs.
3.6%).730

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Darolutamide is a category 1, preferred option for patients with M0 CRPC
if PSADT is less than or equal to 10 months.

Other Secondary Hormone Therapies

Other options for secondary hormone therapy include a first-generation
antiandrogen, antiandrogen withdrawal, corticosteroid, or ketoconazole
(adrenal enzyme inhibitor) with hydrocortisone.732-734 However, none of
these strategies has yet been shown to prolong survival in randomized
clinical trials.

A randomized phase 2 trial, TRANSFORMER, compared the effect of
bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) with that of enzalutamide on PFS in 195
patients with asymptomatic, metastatic CRPC with prior progression on
abiraterone.735 BAT involves rapid cycling between high and low serum
testosterone to disrupt the adaptive upregulation of the androgen receptor
that occurs with low testosterone levels. Patients in the BAT arm received
testosterone cypionate 400 mg intramuscularly once every 28 days. The
PFS was 5.7 months in both arms (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.83–1.55; P = .42).
Crossover was allowed after disease progression, and OS was similar
between the groups. BAT resulted in more favorable patient-reported
QOL. The Panel awaits more data on this approach.

Chemotherapy, Immunotherapy, and Targeted Therapy
for Metastatic CRPC

Research has expanded the therapeutic options for patients with
metastatic CRPC. In addition to the hormonal and radiopharmaceutical
therapies described in other sections, options include chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. As noted above, selection of
therapy depends on patient preferences, prior treatment exposures, the
presence or absence of symptoms, the location of metastases, the
presence of certain biomarkers, and consideration of potential side effects.

Docetaxel

Two randomized phase 3 studies evaluated docetaxel-based regimens in
symptomatic or rapidly progressive CRPC (TAX 327 and SWOG
9916).591,736,737 TAX 327 compared docetaxel (every 3 weeks or weekly)
plus prednisone to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in 1006 patients.736
Every-3-week docetaxel resulted in higher median OS than mitoxantrone
(18.9 vs. 16.5 months; P = .009). This survival benefit was maintained at
extended follow-up.737 The SWOG 9916 study also showed improved
survival with docetaxel when combined with estramustine compared to
mitoxantrone plus prednisone.591

Docetaxel is FDA-approved for metastatic CRPC. The standard regimen is
every 3 weeks. An alternative to every-3-week docetaxel is a biweekly
regimen of 50 mg/m2. This regimen is based on a large randomized phase
2 trial of 346 patients with metastatic CRPC randomized to either every-2-
week docetaxel or every-3-week docetaxel, each with maintenance of
ADT and prednisone.738 Patients treated with the every-2-week regimen
survived an average of 19.5 months compared to 17.0 months with the
every-3-week regimen (P = .015). Time to progression and PSA decline
rate favored every-2-week therapy. Tolerability was improved with every-
2-week docetaxel; febrile neutropenia rate was 4% versus 14% and other
toxicities and overall QOL were similar.

Treatment with greater than or equal to 8 cycles of docetaxel may be
associated with better OS than fewer cycles in the metastatic CRPC
setting, but prospective trials are necessary to test 6 versus 10 cycles of
docetaxel in the metastatic castration-sensitive and CRPC settings.739
Retrospective analysis from the GETUG-AFU 15 trial suggests that
docetaxel only benefits some patients with CRPC who received docetaxel
in the castration-sensitive setting.740

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Thus, docetaxel is a category 1 preferred option for treatment of
docetaxel-naïve metastatic CRPC. The Panel believes that docetaxel can
be given as a rechallenge after progression on a novel hormone in the
metastatic CRPC setting if given in the castration-sensitive setting.

NCCN panelists agreed that docetaxel rechallenge may be useful in some
patients (category 2A instead of category 1 in this setting), especially in
those who have not shown definitive evidence of progression on prior
docetaxel therapy. Docetaxel rechallenge can be considered in patients
who received docetaxel with ADT in the metastatic castration-sensitive
setting.

Cabazitaxel

In June 2010, the FDA approved cabazitaxel, a semi-synthetic taxane
derivative, for patients with metastatic CRPC previously treated with a
docetaxel-containing regimen. An international randomized phase 3 trial
(TROPIC) randomized 755 patients with progressive metastatic CRPC to
receive cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 or mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2, each with daily
prednisone.741 A 2.4-month improvement in OS was demonstrated with
cabazitaxel compared to mitoxantrone (HR, 0.72; P < .0001). The
improvement in survival was balanced against a higher toxic death rate
with cabazitaxel (4.9% vs. 1.9%), which was due, in large part, to
differences in rates of sepsis and renal failure. Febrile neutropenia was
observed in 7.5% of cabazitaxel-treated patients versus 1.3% of
mitoxantrone-treated patients. The incidences of severe diarrhea (6%),
fatigue (5%), nausea/vomiting (2%), anemia (11%), and thrombocytopenia
(4%) also were higher in cabazitaxel-treated patients, which indicated the
need for vigilance and treatment or prophylaxis in this setting to prevent
febrile neutropenia. The survival benefit was sustained at an updated
analysis with a median follow-up of 25.5 months.742 Furthermore, results of
a post-hoc analysis of this trial suggested that the occurrence of grade ≥3

neutropenia after cabazitaxel treatment was associated with
improvements in both PFS and OS.743

The multicenter CARD study was a randomized, open-label clinical trial
that compared cabazitaxel with either abiraterone or enzalutamide in 255
patients with metastatic CRPC who had previously received docetaxel and
either abiraterone or enzalutamide.744 Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 with
concurrent steroid improved the primary endpoint of radiographic PFS (8.0
vs. 3.7 months; HR, 0.54; P < .0001) and reduced the risk of death (13.6
vs. 11.0 months; HR, 0.64; P = .008) compared with abiraterone or
enzalutamide in these patients. Cabazitaxel was also associated with an
increased rate of pain response and delayed time to pain progression and
SREs.745

The phase 3 open-label, multinational, non-inferiority PROSELICA study
compared 20 mg/m2 cabazitaxel with 25 mg/m2 cabazitaxel in 1200
patients with metastatic CRPC who progressed on docetaxel.746 The lower
dose was found to be noninferior to the higher dose for median OS (13.4
months [95% CI, 12.19–14.88] vs. 14.5 months [95% CI, 13.47–15.28]),
and grade 3/4 adverse events were decreased (39.7% vs. 54.5%). In
particular, grade ≥3 neutropenia rates were 41.8% and 73.3% for the
lower and higher dose groups, respectively.

Results from the phase 3 FIRSTANA study suggested that cabazitaxel has
clinical activity in patients with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC.747 Median
OS, the primary endpoint, was similar between 20 mg/m2 cabazitaxel, 25
mg/m2 cabazitaxel, and 75 mg/m2 docetaxel (24.5 months, 25.2 months,
and 24.3 months, respectively). Cabazitaxel was associated with lower
rates of peripheral sensory neuropathy than docetaxel, particularly at 20
mg/m2 (12% vs. 25%). However, the Panel does not currently recommend
cabazitaxel in docetaxel-naïve patients.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Based on these data, cabazitaxel is included in these Guidelines as a
preferred option after progression occurs on docetaxel in patients with
metastatic CRPC (category 1 after progression on docetaxel and a novel
hormone therapy). Cabazitaxel at 20 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, with or without
growth factor support, is the recommended dose for fit patients.
Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 may be considered for healthy patients who wish
to be more aggressive.

Cabazitaxel should be given with concurrent steroids (daily prednisone or
dexamethasone on the day of chemotherapy). Physicians should follow
current guidelines for prophylactic white blood cell growth factor use,
particularly in this heavily pretreated, high-risk population. In addition,
supportive care should include antiemetics (prophylactic antihistamines,
H2 antagonists, and corticosteroids prophylaxis) and symptom-directed
antidiarrheal agents. Cabazitaxel was tested in patients with hepatic
dysfunction in a small, phase I, dose-escalation study.748 Cabazitaxel was
tolerated in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. However,
cabazitaxel should not be used in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.
Cabazitaxel should be stopped upon clinical disease progression or
intolerance.

Cabazitaxel/Carboplatin

Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m² plus carboplatin AUC 4 mg/mL per minute with
growth factor support can be considered for fit patients with aggressive
variant metastatic CRPC (visceral metastases, low PSA and bulky
disease, high lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], high carcinoembryonic
antigen [CEA], lytic bone metastases, and neuroendocrine prostate cancer
[NEPC] histology) or unfavorable genomics (defects in at least 2 of PTEN,
TP53, and RB1). This recommendation is based on a phase 1–2, open
label, randomized study.749 In the phase 2 portion, 160 patients were
randomized to receive cabazitaxel alone or with carboplatin, and the
primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS. In the ITT population,

median PFS was 4.5 months in the cabazitaxel arm versus 7.3 months in
the cabazitaxel/carboplatin arm (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50–0.95; P = .018).
The most common grade 3–5 adverse events (fatigue, anemia,
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) were all more common in the
combination arm. Post-hoc analyses showed that patients with aggressive
variant disease had a longer median PFS in the combination arm than the
cabazitaxel arm (7.5 vs. 1.7 months; P = .017). Patients without
aggressive variant tumors, on the other hand, had similar median PFS
regardless of treatment (6.5 vs. 6.3 months; P = .38).

Sipuleucel-T

In April 2010, sipuleucel-T became the first in a new class of cancer
immunotherapeutic agents to be approved by the FDA. This autologous
cancer “vaccine” involves collection of the white blood cell fraction-
containing, antigen-presenting cells from each patient; exposure of the
cells to the prostatic acid phosphatase-granulocyte macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (PAP-GM-CSF recombinant fusion protein); and
subsequent reinfusion of the cells. The pivotal study was a phase 3,
multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial (D9902B).750 Five hundred
twelve patients with minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic metastatic
CRPC were randomized 2:1 to receive sipuleucel-T or placebo. Eighteen-
point two percent of patients had received prior chemotherapy, which
included docetaxel; eligibility requirements included no chemotherapy for 3
months and no steroids for 1 month prior to enrollment. Median survival in
the vaccine arm was 25.8 months compared to 21.7 months in the control
arm. In a subset analysis, both those who did and those who did not
receive prior chemotherapy benefited from sipuleucel-T treatment.
Sipuleucel-T treatment resulted in a 22% reduction in mortality risk (HR,
0.78; 95% CI, 0.61–0.98; P = .03). Common complications included mild
to moderate chills (54.1%), pyrexia (29.3%), and headache (16.0%), which
usually were transient.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

A prospective registry of patients with metastatic CRPC, PROCEED,
enrolled 1976 patients from 2011 to 2017, who were followed for a median
of 46.6 months.751 The safety and tolerability of sipuleucel-T were
consistent with previous findings, and the median OS was 30.7 months
(95% CI, 28.6–32.2 months).

Sipuleucel-T is a category 1 option for certain patients with metastatic
CRPC who have not had previous treatment with docetaxel or with a novel
hormone therapy. Benefit of sipuleucel-T has not been reported in patients
with visceral metastases and is not recommended if visceral metastases
are present. Sipuleucel-T is also not recommended for patients with small
cell prostate cancer/NEPC. The Panel prefers that sipuleucel-T be used as
a therapy for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with
metastatic CRPC, so that disease burden is lower and immune function is
potentially more intact. However, it is also an option for patients with
metastatic CRPC who have had prior treatment with docetaxel or a novel
hormone therapy, but not for patients who have already received both.
Patients should have good performance level (ECOG 0-1), estimated life
expectancy greater than 6 months, and no liver metastases. Clinicians and
patients should be aware that the usual markers of benefit (decline in PSA
and improvement in bone or CT scans) are not seen. Therefore, benefit to
the individual patient cannot be ascertained using currently available
testing.

Treatment after sipuleucel-T treatment should proceed as clinically
indicated, particularly if symptoms develop.

Pembrolizumab

The FDA approved the use of pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 antibody, for
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR solid
tumors who have progressed on prior treatment and who have no
satisfactory alternative treatment options in May 2017. This approval was

based on the treatment of 149 patients across five clinical studies
involving MSI-H or dMMR colorectal (n = 90) or non-colorectal (n = 59)
cancer for an objective response rate of 40% (59/149).719 All patients
received greater than or equal to 1 prior regimen. Among the non-
colorectal cohorts, two patients had metastatic CRPC: one achieved a
partial objective response, and the other achieved stable disease for
greater than 9 months.

Outcomes of additional patients with metastatic CRPC treated with
pembrolizumab have been reported.72,752-756 In an early study, 10 patients
with CRPC and non-visceral metastases (bone = 7; lymph nodes = 2;
bone and liver = 1) who had disease progression on enzalutamide were
treated with pembrolizumab and enzalutamide.752 Some of the patients
also had experienced disease progression on additional therapies
(docetaxel for castration-sensitive disease, abiraterone, and/or sipuleucel-
T). Three of the 10 patients showed a near complete PSA response. Two
of these three patients had radiographically measurable disease and
achieved a partial radiographic response (including a response in liver
metastases). Of the remaining patients, three showed stable disease, and
four displayed no evidence of clinical benefit. Genetic analysis of biopsy
tissue revealed that one patient whose disease showed PSA response
had an MSI-H tumor, whereas the other patient with responsive disease
and two with non-responsive disease did not. The nonrandomized phase
Ib KEYNOTE-028 trial included 23 patients with advanced, progressive
prostate cancer, of whom 74% had received greater than or equal to two
previous therapies for metastatic disease.754 The objective response rate
by investigator review was 17.4% (95% CI, 5.0%–38.8%), with four
confirmed partial responses. Eight patients (34.8%) had stable disease.
Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 61% of patients after a
median follow-up of 7.9 months; 17% of the cohort experienced grade 3/4
events (ie, grade 4 lipase increase, grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, grade
3 asthenia, grade 3 fatigue).

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

KEYNOTE-199 was a multi-cohort, open-label phase II study in 258
patients with metastatic CRPC and prior treatment with docetaxel and at
least one novel hormonal therapy that assessed pembrolizumab in
patients regardless of MSI status.757 Cohorts 1 and 2 included patients with
PD-L1–positive (n = 133) and PD-L1–negative (n = 66) prostate cancer,
respectively. Cohort 3 included those with bone-predominant disease with
positive or negative PD-L1 expression (n = 59). The primary endpoint of
overall response rate (ORR) was 5% (95% CI, 2%–11%) in cohort 1 and
3% (95% CI, <1%–11%) in cohort 2. Responses were durable (range, 1.9
– ≥21.8 months).

The most common adverse events from pembrolizumab are fatigue,
pruritus, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, nausea, rash, fever, cough,
dyspnea, and musculoskeletal pain. Pembrolizumab also may be
associated with immune-mediated side effects, which include colitis,
hepatitis, endocrinopathies, pneumonitis, or nephritis.

Based on the available data, the Panel supports the use of pembrolizumab
in patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic CRPC whose disease has
progressed through docetaxel and a novel hormone therapy. The
prevalence of MMR deficiency in metastatic CPRC is estimated at 2% to
5%,36,753 and testing for MSI-H or dMMR can be performed using DNA
testing or immunohistochemistry. If tumor MSI-H or dMMR is identified, the
Panel recommends referral to genetic counseling for consideration of
germline testing for Lynch syndrome.

In June 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval for pembrolizumab’s
use in patients with unresectable or metastatic TMB-high (TMB-H) [≥10
mutations/megabase (mut/Mb)] solid tumors that have progressed
following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative
treatment options. Results from prospective biomarker analysis of the
multicohort, non-randomized, open-label, phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 trial
support this approval.758 The prospective TMB study included an efficacy

population of 790 patients with anal, biliary, cervical, endometrial,
mesothelioma, neuroendocrine, salivary, small cell lung, thyroid, or vulvar
cancer who were evaluable for TMB. Of these, 102 patients (13%) had
TMB-H status. Objective responses to pembrolizumab were seen in 30 of
102 patients in the TMB-H group (29%; 95% CI, 21%–39%) and 43 of 688
patients in the non–TMB-H group (6%; 95% CI, 5%–8%). Safety was as
expected based on other studies of pembrolizumab. Even though there
were no patients with prostate cancer in the TMB pembrolizumab study,
the Panel includes pembrolizumab as an option for patients with
metastatic CRPC, prior docetaxel and novel hormone therapy, and TMB
≥10 mut/Mb based on extrapolation from other tumor types.

Mitoxantrone

Two randomized trials assessed the role of mitoxantrone in patients with
metastatic CRPC.759,760 Although there was no improvement in OS,
palliative responses and improvements in QOL were seen with
mitoxantrone.

Mitoxantrone can be used for palliation in symptomatic patients with
metastatic CRPC who cannot tolerate other therapies after disease
progression on prior docetaxel.

Treatment Options for Patients with DNA Repair Gene Mutations

Early studies suggest germline and somatic mutations in HRR genes (eg,
BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D, CHEK2) may be
predictive of the clinical benefit of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)
inhibitors.761-763 PARP inhibitors are oral agents that exert their activity
through the concept of synthetic lethality.764 PARP inhibitor therapy options
are discussed below.

DNA repair defects have also been reported to be predictive for sensitivity
to platinum agents in CRPC and other cancers.765-769 Platinum agents have

Prostate Cancer

shown some activity in patients with CRPC without molecular selection.770
Studies of platinum agents in patients with CRPC that have DNA repair
gene mutations are needed.

In addition, results of one study suggested that patients with metastatic
CRPC and germline mutations in DNA repair genes may have better
outcomes if treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide than with taxanes.44
However, it should be noted that the response of patients with metastatic
CRPC and HRR gene mutations to standard therapies is similar to the
response of patients without mutations.771,772

RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L). The primary endpoint of
improving radiographic PFS with olaparib versus abiraterone/enzalutamide
was met in cohort A (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25–0.47; P < .001), and
radiographic PFS was also superior in the entire study population
encompassing cohorts A+B (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38–0.63; P < .001).

In addition, final OS analysis of PROfound showed that OS was improved
with olaparib versus abiraterone/enzalutamide in cohort A (HR, 0.69; 95%
CI, 0.50–0.97; P = .02), despite the fact that 86 of 131 patients (66%)
crossed over to olaparib after disease progression in the control arm.777

Patients with CDK12 mutations tend to have aggressive disease, with high
rates of metastases and short OS. Their disease also does not respond
well to hormonal therapy, PARP inhibitors, or taxanes. Two large, multi-
institutional, retrospective studies have shown that 11% to 33% of patients
with metastatic CRPC and CDK12 mutations experienced disease
response to PD-1 inhibitors (ie, nivolumab, pembrolizumab), some with
durable responses.773,774 The Panel awaits more data on the use of PD-1
inhibition in patients with CDK12 mutations.

Olaparib
Preliminary clinical data using olaparib suggested favorable activity of this
agent in patients with HRR gene mutations, but not in those without HRR
mutations.762,763,775 The phase 3 PROfound study was a randomized trial
evaluating olaparib 300 mg twice daily versus physician’s choice of
abiraterone or enzalutamide in patients with metastatic CRPC and
progression on at least one novel hormonal agent (abiraterone or
enzalutamide) and up to one prior taxane agent (permitted but not
required).776 Patients were required to have a somatic or germline HRR
gene mutation, and were allocated to one of two cohorts: cohort A
comprised patients with BRCA1/2 or ATM mutations, and cohort B
comprised patients with a mutation in at least one of 12 other HRR genes
(BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A,

The Panel notes that there may be heterogeneity of response to olaparib
based on which gene has a mutation. Efficacy in PROfound appears to be
driven by the cohort of patients with at least one alteration in BRCA2,
BRCA1, or ATM, and in particular by patients with BRCA2 or BRCA1
mutations based on exploratory gene-by-gene analysis.777 Patients with
BRCA2 mutations in PROfound experienced an OS benefit with olaparib
(HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37–0.95), whereas the HR for OS in patients with
ATM mutations was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.53–1.75).777 Furthermore, there were
few patients in PROfound with mutations in some of the genes. For
example, only 4 patients had BRIP1 mutations (2 in olaparib arm and 2 in
control arm), 2 patients had RAD51D mutations (both in olaparib arm), and
no patients had RAD51C mutations.776 Patients with PPP2R2A mutations
in PROfound experienced an unfavorable risk-benefit profile.

As a result of the favorable efficacy data from the PROfound trial, the FDA
approved olaparib (300 mg twice daily) in May 2020 for use in patients
with metastatic CRPC and deleterious or suspected deleterious germline
or somatic HRR gene mutations in at least one of 14 genes (BRCA1,
BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2,
RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L) and who had previously
received treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

Since prior taxane therapy was not mandated in the PROfound study,
olaparib use might be reasonable in metastatic CRPC patients before or
after docetaxel treatment. Adverse events that may occur with olaparib
treatment include anemia (including that requiring transfusion), fatigue,
nausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia,
creatinine elevation, cough, and dyspnea. Rare but serious side effects
may include thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli), drug-
induced pneumonitis, and a theoretical risk of myelodysplasia or acute
myeloid leukemia.776

The Panel recommends olaparib as an option for patients with metastatic
CRPC, previous androgen receptor-directed therapy, and an HRRm
regardless of prior docetaxel therapy (category 1). The HRR genes to be
considered for use of olaparib are BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1,
CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D
and RAD54L.

Any commercially available analytically and clinically validated somatic
tumor and ctDNA assays and germline assays can be used to identify
patients for treatment. Careful monitoring of complete blood counts and
hepatic and renal function, along with type and screens and potential
transfusion support and/or dose reductions as needed for severe anemia
or intolerance are recommended during olaparib therapy.

Rucaparib
Rucaparib is another PARP inhibitor approved for use in patients with
metastatic CRPC. This agent received accelerated FDA approval in May
2020 based on the preliminary favorable data from the TRITON2 clinical
trial. In that open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial, patients with metastatic
CRPC harboring a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or
somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, who had previously received therapy
with a novel hormonal agent plus one taxane chemotherapy, were treated
with rucaparib 600 mg twice daily.778 The primary endpoint of TRITON2

was the objective response rate in patients with measurable disease, and
was 43.5% (95% CI, 31.0%–56.7%) in this BRCA1/2-mutated population.
Median radiographic PFS, a key secondary endpoint, was 9.0 months
(95% CI, 8.3–13.5 months). The most common adverse events were
asthenia/fatigue, nausea, and anemia/decreased hemoglobin, with grade
≥3 anemia/decreased hemoglobin in 25.2% of participants. Final analysis
of TRITON2 confirmed results of the earlier analysis.779

In the randomized phase 3 TRITON3 study, patients with metastatic
CRPC and a germline or somatic BRCA1/2 or ATM mutation who have
previously received a novel hormonal agent but no chemotherapy for
mCRPC were randomized 2:1 to rucaparib versus physician’s choice of
therapy (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or docetaxel).780 The primary endpoint
of TRITON3, the median duration of imaging-based PFS, was significantly
longer at 62 months in the group of 270 participants assigned to receive
rucaparib than in the 135 participants who received a control medication
(10.2 months vs. 6.4 months; HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47–0.80; P < .001).
This effect was also seen in the 201 patients and 101 patients in each
group with a BRCAm (11.2 months vs. 6.4 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI,
0.36–0.69). For those with ATM mutations, an exploratory analysis
suggested a possible improvement as well (8.1 months vs. 6.8 months;
HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.59–1.52). As in TRITON2, the most frequent adverse
events with rucaparib were fatigue and nausea.

The Panel recommends rucaparib as an option for patients with metastatic
CRPC, prior treatment with a novel hormone therapy, and a BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutation. Rucaparib should not be used in patients with HRR
gene mutations other than BRCA1/2.781 Adverse events that may occur
with rucaparib include anemia (including that requiring transfusion),
fatigue, asthenia, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea or
constipation, thrombocytopenia, increased creatinine, increased liver
transaminases, and rash. Rare but serious side effects of rucaparib

Prostate Cancer

include a theoretical risk of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia, as
well as fetal teratogenicity.778,781

The preferred method of selecting patients for rucaparib treatment is
somatic analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 using a circulating tumor DNA
sample. As with olaparib, careful monitoring of complete blood counts and
hepatic and renal function, along with type and screens and potential
transfusion support and/or dose reductions as needed for severe anemia
or intolerance are recommended during treatment with rucaparib.

Olaparib Plus Abiraterone
Pre-clinical data suggest that PARP-1 promotes androgen receptor
activity.782 Additional pre-clinical data show that androgen receptor
inhibitors can down-regulate DNA repair genes, creating a situation similar
to that of HRR mutation.783,784 These results suggest that the combination
of PARP inhibition with androgen receptor inhibition may have an
enhanced antitumor effect and that this effect may not be limited to
patients with HRR mutations. In fact, a randomized phase 2 trial showed
that the combination of abiraterone with olaparib increased radiographic
PFS over abiraterone and placebo in patients with metastatic CRPC
regardless of HRR status (ITT population: HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44–0.97; P
= .034).763

The PROpel trial was an international, double-blind, phase 3 trial
comparing abiraterone and olaparib with abiraterone and placebo in 796
patients with metastatic CRPC regardless of HRR mutation status.785 Prior
docetaxel in the localized or metastatic castration-sensitive setting was
allowed, but patients were untreated for CRPC. The primary endpoint,
imaging-based PFS by investigator assessment in the ITT population, was
significantly longer in the abiraterone/olaparib group than in the
abiraterone/placebo group (24.8 vs. 16.6 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54–
0.81; P < .001). HRR mutations were identified in tumors of 226 patients;
552 patients did not have HRR tumor mutations. The HR for the primary

endpoint in those with HRR mutations was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.34–0.73). The
safety profile of the olaparib/abiraterone combination was as expected
based on the known safety profiles of the individual drugs, with the most
common adverse events being anemia, fatigue/asthenia, and nausea.

OS data from PROpel were presented at the 2023 ASCO Genitourinary
Cancers Symposium.786 A trend towards an OS benefit with the
abiraterone/olaparib combination was seen in the ITT population and in
the HRRm, non-HRRm, BRCAm, and non-BRCAm subgroups. However,
crossover was not allowed, so patients with HRRm in the control arm were
unable to receive olaparib, likely contributing to the inferior survival in the
control group.

In May 2023, the FDA approved the combination of olaparib with
abiraterone for the treatment of adult patients with BRCAm metastatic
CRPC. Based on the results of PROpel, olaparib/abiraterone is included in
the NCCN Guidelines as an option in first-line metastatic CRPC for
patients with a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (germline and/or
somatic) who have not yet received a novel hormone therapy or docetaxel
(category 1) and for those who received prior docetaxel in the castration-
sensitive setting (category 2A).

Talazoparib Plus Enzalutamide
Talazoparib is another PARP inhibitor; it has had an FDA indication in
breast cancer. The open-label, international phase 2 TALAPRO-1 trial
included 127 patients with an HRR mutation and progressive, metastatic
CRPC, all of whom received at least one dose of talazoparib.787 The
objective response rate after a median follow-up of 16.4 months was
29.8% (95% CI, 21.2–39.6). The most common grade 3–4 treatment-
emergent adverse events were anemia (31%), thrombocytopenia (9%),
and neutropenia (8%).

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025
Prostate Cancer

As noted above (see Olaparib Plus Abiraterone), pre-clinical data suggest
that the PARP inhibition combined with androgen receptor inhibition may
have an enhanced antitumor effect that may not be limited to those with
HRR mutations. The randomized, double-blind, phase 3 TALAPRO-2
study compared enzalutamide plus talazoparib with enzalutamide plus
placebo in 805 patients with untreated metastatic CRPC.788 HRR gene
alteration status and treatment with docetaxel and/or abiraterone in the
castration-sensitive setting were used to stratify the randomization. The
primary endpoint was radiographic PFS in the ITT population. At the
planned primary analysis, median radiographic PFS was not reached
(95% CI, 27.5 months–not reached) for the talazoparib group and was
21.9 months (95% CI, 16.6–25.1) for the control group (HR, 0.63; 95% CI,
0.51–0.78; P < .0001).

HRR mutations were present in 21% of TALAPRO-2 participants, with
BRCA alterations being the most common.788 The HR for radiographic PFS
in the HRR-deficient subgroup was more strongly in favor of the
talazoparib combination than in the HRR-proficient/unknown population
(0.46 [95% CI, 0.30–0.70; P = .0003] vs. 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54–0.89; P =
.0039]). Among HRR mutations, talazoparib conferred a 77% lower risk of
radiographic progression or death in those with tumor mutations in BRCA1
or BRCA2 (HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.10–0.53; P = .0002), whereas the
corresponding reduction was 34% (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.39–1.12; P = .12)
in those with non-BRCA HRR alterations.

Prior therapy also affected the radiographic PFS outcomes in this trial.788
In the 179 participants in TALAPRO-2 who had received docetaxel in
earlier disease settings, the HR for radiographic PFS was 0.51 (95% CI,
0.32–0.81; P = .0034). In the small population of 50 participants in the ITT
population who had received prior novel hormonal therapy, the
corresponding HR was non-significant at 0.57 (95% CI, 0.28–1.16; P =
.12).

The safety profile of enzalutamide plus talazoparib was consistent with the
known safety profiles of the individual drugs, with the most common
adverse events in those who received talazoparib being anemia,
neutropenia, and fatigue. However, hematologic adverse events were of
higher grades and occurred more frequently than would be expected with
talazoparib alone. Overall, the combination had significant toxicity, with
dose interruption due to adverse events in 75% of participants in the
talazoparib group compared with 23% in the placebo group. Dose
reductions due to adverse events occurred in 56% and 7% of the
talazoparib and placebo groups, respectively.

Based on these results, the FDA approved talazoparib plus enzalutamide
for HRRm metastatic CRPC in June 2023. The Panel includes talazoparib
plus enzalutamide as a treatment option for patients with metastatic CRPC
and a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in one of certain
HRR and other DNA repair genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, ATR, CDK12,
CHEK2, FANCA, MLH1, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, or RAD51C) who have
not yet had treatment in the setting of CRPC. This is a category 1
recommendation for those without prior docetaxel or prior novel hormone
therapy. It is a category 2A recommendation for those with prior docetaxel
in the castration-sensitive setting and no prior novel hormone therapy. Use
of talazoparib/enzalutamide for those who have received prior novel
hormone therapy without prior docetaxel is controversial (category 2B)
because a benefit of this combination over use of a PARP inhibitor alone
has not been shown in this setting, but responses are likely.

Niraparib Plus Abiraterone
Another PARP inhibitor, niraparib, has also been studied in combination
with androgen inhibition in the setting of metastatic CRPC. The
randomized, double-blinded phase 3 MAGNITUDE trial compared

without HRR mutations.789 Prior chemotherapy and novel hormonal
therapy were allowed in the metastatic castration-sensitive or M0 CRPC
settings, and were received by 3.1% and 20.1% of the total HRRm cohort,
respectively.

The primary endpoint of MAGNITUDE was radiographic PFS. After a
median follow-up of 18.6 months, radiographic PFS was improved for
those receiving niraparib in the HRRm group overall (16.5 months vs. 13.7
months; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56–0.96; P = .022) as well as in the BRCAm
subgroup (16.6 months vs. 10.9 months; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36–0.79; P
= .001). However, radiographic PFS was not improved in the subgroup of
patients with non-BRCA HRR mutations (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68–1.44).
For the cohort without HRR mutations, futility was declared based on
prespecified criteria. The secondary endpoints of time to symptomatic
progression and time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy were
improved with the combination therapy in the HRRm and BRCAm cohorts.

A second interim analysis of MAGNITUDE included a prespecified, inverse
probability censoring weighting analysis of OS, which was designed to
account for the receipt of subsequent therapies, including PARP
inhibitors.790 Results of this analysis suggest that there may be an OS
benefit for the combination therapy (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33–0.90; nominal
P = .0181).

The incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was higher with the
combination of niraparib plus abiraterone compared with placebo and
abiraterone (67.0% vs. 46.4%).789 Anemia (28.3% vs. 7.6%) and
hypertension (14.6% vs. 12.3%) were the most reported grade ≥3 adverse
events. Overall, the combination was tolerable and QOL was maintained.

Based on these results, the FDA approved niraparib plus abiraterone for
the treatment of patients with BRCAm metastatic CRPC in August 2023.
The Panel includes niraparib plus abiraterone as a treatment option for

patients with metastatic CRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have not yet had treatment in the
setting of metastatic CRPC. This is a category 1 recommendation for
those without prior docetaxel or prior novel hormone therapy. It is a
category 2A recommendation for those with prior docetaxel and no prior
novel hormone therapy. Use of niraparib/abiraterone for those who have
received prior novel hormone therapy without prior docetaxel is
controversial (category 2B) because a benefit of this combination over use
of a PARP inhibitor alone has not been shown in this setting, but
responses are likely.

Radiopharmaceuticals for Metastatic CRPC

Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan

Lu-177-PSMA-617 is a radiopharmaceutical that is administered
intravenously and is indicated for PSMA-positive M1 CRPC that has been
treated with androgen receptor pathway inhibition and taxane-based
chemotherapy. The active moiety is a radionuclide that delivers radiation
to PSMA-expressing and surrounding cells, which induces DNA damage
and leads to cell death. The approval of Lu-177-PSMA-617 was based on
the international, open-label phase III VISION trial of 831 patients with M1
CRPC and PSMA-positive metastatic lesions. Patients in VISION were
previously treated with at least one androgen receptor-directed therapy
and one or two taxane-based chemotherapy regimens.791 Patients had at
least one PSMA-positive metastatic lesion and no PSMA-negative lesions
determined by Ga-68 labeled PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging. Patients were
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive standard of care (abiraterone,
enzalutamide, bisphosphonates, RT, denosumab, and/or glucocorticoids)
and Lu-177-PSMA-617 (7.4 GBq or 200 mCi every 6 weeks for 4–6
cycles) or standard of care alone.

The median OS was improved in the Lu-177-PSMA-617 group compared
to the control group (15.3 months vs. 11.3 months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI,

0.52–0.74; P < .001). Similarly, the median PFS was improved in the Lu-
177-PSMA-617 group compared to the control group (8.7 months vs. 3.4
months; HR, 0.40; 99.2% CI, 0.29–0.57; P < .001). The incidence of grade
≥3 adverse events (particularly anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia,
and fatigue) was significantly higher in the Lu-177-PSMA-617 group
compared to the control group. 791

The NCCN Panel recommends Lu-177-PSMA-617 as a category 1, useful
in certain circumstances treatment option for patients with one or more
PSMA-positive lesion and/or metastatic disease that is predominately
PSMA-positive and with no dominant PSMA-negative metastatic lesions
who have been treated previously with androgen receptor-directed therapy
and a taxane-based chemotherapy. PSMA-negative lesions are defined as
metastatic disease that lacks PSMA uptake including bone with soft tissue
components ≥1.0 cm, lymph nodes ≥2.5 cm in short axis, and solid organ
metastases ≥1.0 cm in size. Although the FDA has approved Ga-68
PSMA-11 for use with Lu-177–PSMA-617, the panel believes that F-18
piflufolastat PSMA and F-18 flotufolastat PSMA can also be used in the
same space due to multiple reports describing the equivalency of these
imaging agents.

Radium-223

In May 2013, the FDA approved radium-223 dichloride, an alpha particle-
emitting radioactive agent. This first-in-class radiopharmaceutical was
approved for treatment of metastatic CRPC in patients with symptomatic
bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease. Approval was
based on clinical data from a multicenter, phase 3, randomized trial
(ALSYMPCA) that included 921 patients with symptomatic CRPC, two or
more bone metastases, and no known visceral disease.792 Fifty-seven
percent of the patients received prior docetaxel and all patients received
best supportive care. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 6 monthly
radium-223 intravenous injections or placebo. Compared to placebo,

radium-223 significantly improved OS (median 14.9 months vs. 11.3
months; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.058–0.83; P < .001) and prolonged time to
first SRE (median 15.6 months vs. 9.8 months). Preplanned subset
analyses showed that the survival benefit of radium-223 was maintained
regardless of prior docetaxel use.793 ITT analyses from ALSYMPCA
showed that radium-223 also may reduce the risk of symptomatic SREs.794
Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity was low (3% neutropenia, 6%
thrombocytopenia, and 13% anemia), likely due to the short range of
radioactivity.792 Fecal elimination of the agent led to generally mild non-
hematologic side effects, which included nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.
Radium-223 was associated with improved or slower decline of QOL in
ALSYMPCA.795

The multicenter, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3
ERA 223 trial randomized patients with bone-metastatic chemotherapy-
naïve CRPC to abiraterone with or without radium-223.796 The patients
were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The primary endpoint of
symptomatic skeletal event-free survival in the ITT population was not
met. In fact, the addition of radium-223 to abiraterone was associated with
an increased frequency of bone fractures compared with placebo. The
PEACE III trial (NCT02194842) is also comparing radium-223 in
combination with a secondary hormonal therapy to secondary hormone
therapy alone in patients with mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC. In this
trial, the use of bone-protecting agents (denosumab or zoledronic acid)
was made mandatory following results from ERA 223. The cumulative
incidence of fractures at 1.5 years in patients who received a bone-
protecting agent was 2.8% in participants receiving radium-223 plus
enzalutamide and 3.9% in those receiving enzalutamide alone.797 In the
absence of bone agents, these numbers were 45.9% and 22.3%,
respectively. This result suggests that radium-223 combined with a
secondary hormone therapy may be safe if preventive administration of a
bone agent is used. The Panel awaits further efficacy data before

Prostate Cancer

recommending radium-223 in combination with a secondary hormonal
therapy.

Radium-223 is a category 1 option to treat symptomatic bone metastases
without visceral metastases. Hematologic evaluation should be performed
according to the FDA label before treatment initiation and before each
subsequent dose.719 Radium-223 given in combination with chemotherapy
(such as docetaxel) outside of a clinical trial has the potential for additive
myelosuppression.719 It is not recommended for use in combination with
docetaxel or any other systemic therapy except ADT. It should not be used
in patients with visceral metastases. Based on the PEACE III results
described above, all patients receiving radium-223 should be given
concomitant denosumab or zoledronic acid.

Small Cell/Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer

De novo small cell carcinoma in untreated prostate cancer occurs rarely
and is very aggressive.798 Treatment-associated small cell prostate
cancer/NEPC that occurs in patients with metastatic CRPC is more
common.799 In a multi-institution prospective series of 202 consecutive
patients with metastatic CRPC, all of whom underwent metastatic
biopsies, small cell/neuroendocrine histology was present in 17% of
patients.799 Patients with small cell/neuroendocrine tumors and prior
abiraterone and/or enzalutamide had a shorter OS when compared with
those with adenocarcinoma and prior abiraterone and/or enzalutamide
(HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.07–3.82). Genomic analysis showed that DNA repair
mutations and small cell/neuroendocrine histology were almost mutually
exclusive.

Small cell/neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate should be considered
in patients with disease that no longer responds to ADT and who test
positive for metastases. These relatively rare tumors are associated with
low PSA levels despite large metastatic burden and visceral disease.800

Those with initial Grade Group 5 are especially at risk. Biopsy of
accessible metastatic lesions to identify patients with small
cell/neuroendocrine histomorphologic features is recommended in patients
with metastatic CRPC.

These patients may be treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy (ie,
cisplatin/etoposide, carboplatin/etoposide, docetaxel/carboplatin,
cabazitaxel/carboplatin).749,801,802 Physicians should consult the NCCN
Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer for additional options in the first and
subsequent lines of therapy (available at www.NCCN.org), because the
behavior of small cell/neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate is similar
to that of small cell carcinoma of the lung.

Additional Treatment Options for Bone Metastases

In a multicenter study, 643 patients with CRPC and asymptomatic or
minimally symptomatic bone metastases were randomized to intravenous
zoledronic acid every 3 weeks or placebo.803 At 15 months, fewer patients
in the zoledronic acid 4-mg group than patients in the placebo group had
SREs (33% vs. 44%; P = .02). An update at 24 months also revealed an
increase in the median time to first SRE (488 days vs. 321 days; P =
.01).804 No significant differences were found in OS. Other
bisphosphonates have not been shown to be effective for prevention of
disease-related skeletal complications. Earlier use of zoledronic acid in
patients with castration-sensitive prostate cancer and bone metastases is
not associated with lower risk for SREs, and in general should not be used
for SRE prevention until the development of metastatic CRPC.805

The randomized TRAPEZE trial used a 2 X 2 factorial design to compare
clinical PFS (pain progression, SREs, or death) as the primary outcome in
757 patients with bone metastatic CRPC treated with docetaxel alone or
with zoledronic acid, 89Sr, or both.806 The bone-directed therapies had no
statistically significant effect on the primary outcome or on OS in

Prostate Cancer

unadjusted analysis. However, adjusted analysis revealed a small effect
for 89Sr on clinical PFS (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73–0.99; P = .03). For
secondary outcomes, zoledronic acid improved the SRE-free interval (HR,
0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.95; P = .01) and decreased the total SREs (424 vs.
605) compared with docetaxel alone.

Denosumab was compared to zoledronic acid in a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with CRPC.807 The absolute
incidence of SREs was similar in the two groups; however, the median
time to first SRE was delayed by 3.6 months by denosumab compared to
zoledronic acid (20.7 vs. 17.1 months; P = .0002 for non-inferiority, P =
.008 for superiority). The rates of important SREs with denosumab were
similar to zoledronic acid and included spinal cord compression (3% vs.
4%), need for radiation (19% vs. 21%), and pathologic fracture (14% vs.
15%).

Treatment-related toxicities reported for zoledronic acid and denosumab
were similar and included hypocalcemia (more common with denosumab
13% vs. 6%), arthralgias, and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ, 1%–2%
incidence). Most, but not all, patients who develop ONJ have preexisting
dental problems.808

Therefore, denosumab every 4 weeks (category 1, preferred) or zoledronic
acid every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended for patients with CRPC and bone
metastases to prevent or delay disease-associated SREs. SREs include
pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, operation, or EBRT to
bone. The optimal duration of zoledronic acid or denosumab in patients
with CRPC and bone metastases remains unclear. A multi-institutional,
open-label, randomized trial in 1822 patients with bone-metastatic prostate
cancer, breast cancer, or multiple myeloma found that zoledronic acid
every 12 weeks was non-inferior to zoledronic acid every 4 weeks.809 In
the every-12-weeks and every-4-weeks arms, 28.6% and 29.5%
experienced at least 1 SRE within 2 years of randomization, respectively.

Oral hygiene, baseline dental evaluation for high-risk individuals, and
avoidance of invasive dental surgery during therapy are recommended to
reduce the risk of ONJ.810 If invasive dental surgery is necessary, therapy
should be deferred until the dentist confirms that the patient has healed
completely from the dental procedure. Supplemental calcium and vitamin
D are recommended to prevent hypocalcemia in patients receiving either
denosumab or zoledronic acid.

Monitoring of creatinine clearance is required to guide dosing of zoledronic
acid. Zoledronic acid should be dose reduced in patients with impaired
renal function (estimated creatinine clearance 30–60 mL/min) and held for
creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. Denosumab may be administered to
patients with impaired renal function or even patients on hemodialysis;
however, the risk for severe hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia is
greater, and the dose, schedule, and safety of denosumab have not yet
been defined. A single study of 55 patients with creatinine clearance <30
mL/min or on hemodialysis evaluated the use of 60-mg-dose
denosumab.719 Hypocalcemia should be corrected before starting
denosumab, and serum calcium monitoring is required for denosumab and
recommended for zoledronic acid, with repletion as needed.

Radium-223 is a category 1 option to treat symptomatic bone metastases
without visceral metastases. The use of palliative, systemic radiation with
either 89Sr or 153Sm with or without focal EBRT remains an option,
though they are seldom used these days with other available options (see
Radium-223, above). EBRT alone is also an option.

Clinical research on the prevention or delay of disease spread to bone
continues. A phase 3 randomized trial of 1432 patients with non-metastatic
CRPC at high risk of bone involvement showed that denosumab delayed
bone metastasis by 4 months compared to placebo.811 OS was not
improved, and the FDA did not approve denosumab for the prevention of
bone metastases.

Considerations for Visceral Metastases

The panel defines visceral metastases as those occurring in the liver, lung,
adrenal gland, peritoneum, or brain. Soft tissue/lymph node sites are not
considered visceral metastases. In general, there are fewer data on
treatment of patients with CRPC and visceral metastases than for those
without visceral metastases. This is especially true in patients who have
already received docetaxel and a novel hormone therapy, where most
systemic therapies are given a category 2B recommendation.

Sequencing of Therapy in CRPC

The number of treatment options for patients with CRPC has expanded
rapidly over the past several years. Although the optimal sequence of
therapies remains undefined, some data are emerging that can help with
treatment selection in some cases.

After abiraterone or enzalutamide, data suggest that giving the alternate
novel hormone therapy may not be the optimal strategy considering the
availability of other treatment options, including chemotherapy. The CARD
trial, for instance, showed that treatment with cabazitaxel significantly
improved clinical outcomes over enzalutamide or abiraterone in patients
with metastatic CRPC who had been previously treated with docetaxel and
the alternate hormonal therapy (abiraterone or enzalutamide).744
Furthermore, data suggest cross-resistance between abiraterone and
enzalutamide.812-815 Results of a randomized, open-label, phase 2,
crossover trial suggest that the sequence of abiraterone followed by
enzalutamide is more efficacious than the reverse.816

Some data inform the sequencing of therapies in patients with actionable
biomarkers. The multicenter, unblinded, randomized phase 2 TheraP trial
compared PSA response after Lu-177-PSMA-617 vs. cabazitaxel in 200
patients with PSMA-positive metastatic CRPC who previously received
docetaxel.817 Prior androgen receptor-directed therapy was permitted.

Among the ITT population, the PSA response rate was 66% in the Lu-177-
PSMA-617 arm compared with 37% in the cabazitaxel arm (difference
29%; 95% CI, 16–42; P < .0001). These numbers were 66% and 44%,
respectively, in those who received treatment (difference 23%; 95% CI, 9–
37; P = .0016). Furthermore, grade 3–4 adverse events were less frequent
in the Lu-177-PSMA-617 arm than in the cabazitaxel arm (33% vs. 53%).
Results from the phase 3 PSMAfore trial (NCT04689828), which may
inform the choice between Lu-177-PSMA-617 and switching to a different
androgen receptor-directed therapy in docetaxel-naïve patients, are
awaited. Data for patients with HRRm metastatic CRPC are more limited,
but comparative effectiveness research suggests that olaparib may result
in superior radiographic PFS than cabazitaxel in patients with BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutations and prior treatment with docetaxel.818

No chemotherapy regimen has demonstrated improved survival or QOL
after cabazitaxel or cabazitaxel/carboplatin, although several systemic
agents other than mitoxantrone have shown palliative and radiographic
response benefits in clinical trials (ie, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vinorelbine, carboplatin/etoposide, docetaxel/carboplatin,
gemcitabine/oxaliplatin, paclitaxel/carboplatin819-828). No survival benefit for
these combination regimens over sequential single-agent regimens has
been demonstrated, and toxicity is higher. Treatment with these regimens
could be considered after an informed discussion between the physician
and an individual patient about treatment goals and risks/side effects and
alternatives, which must include best supportive care. Prednisone or
dexamethasone at low doses may provide palliative benefits in the
chemotherapy-refractory setting.829 Participation in a clinical trial is
encouraged.

The intention of these guidelines is to provide a framework on which to
base treatment decisions. Prostate cancer is a complex disease, with

many controversial aspects of management and with a dearth of sound

variables (including adjusted life expectancy, disease characteristics,

* Interpret with caution. Wherever possible, studies were included that used histopathologic confirmation, but not all studies used confirmatory
histology as the gold standard. Values may vary depending upon the site of the lesion and phase of the disease process.

** CLR: Correct localization rate. Patient-level positive predictive value + anatomic lesion co-localization. Preferred over sensitivity and specificity in
analyses of patients with BCR.
